<h2>TOPPLETON'S CLIENT.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INTRODUCING MR. HOPKINS TOPPLETON.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mr. Hopkins Toppleton</span>, Barrister of London
and New York, was considered by his intimates
a most fortunate young man. He was
accounted the happy possessor of an income
of something over fifty thousand dollars a year,
derived from investments which time had shown
to be as far removed from instability, and as
little influenced by the fluctuations of the stock
market, as the pyramids of Egypt themselves.
Better than this, however, better even than
personal beauty, with which he was plentifully
endowed, Mr. Hopkins Toppleton was blessed
with a great name, which he had received
ready-made from his illustrious father, late
head of the legal firm of Toppleton, Morley,
Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson, Smithers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and Hicks. The value of the name to Hopkins
was unquestionable, since it enabled him, at his
father's death, to enter that famous aggregation
of legal talent as a special partner, although his
knowledge of law was scant, receiving a share
of the profits of the concern for the use of his
patronymic, which, owing to his father's pre-eminent
success at the Bar, Messrs. Morley,
Harkins, <i>et al.</i>, were anxious to retain. This
desire of Mr. Toppleton's late associates was
most natural, for such was the tremendous
force exerted by the name he bore, that plaintiffs
when they perceived it arrayed in opposition to
their claims, not infrequently withdrew their
suits, or offered terms upon which any defendant
of sense might be induced to compromise. On
the other hand, when a defendant found himself
confronted with the fact that Hopkins
Toppleton, Sen., had joined forces with the
plaintiff, he usually either settled the claim
against him in full or placed himself beyond
the jurisdiction of the courts.</div>

<p>When Toppleton, Sen., died, it was very
generally believed that the firm, whose name
has already been mentioned at some length,
lost not only its head, but also a very large
proportion of its brains,&mdash;a situation quite as
logical as it was unfortunate for the gentlemen
with whom Mr. Toppleton had been associated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Nor was this feeling, that with the departure of
Toppleton, the illustrious, for other worlds the
firm was deprived of a most considerable portion
of its claims to high standing, confined to
cavilling outsiders. No one recognized the
unhappy state of affairs at the busy office on
Broadway more quickly than did Messrs.
Morley, Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson,
Smithers, and Hicks themselves, and at the
first meeting of the firm, after the funeral of
their dead partner, these gentlemen unanimously
resolved that something must be done.</p>

<p>It was at this meeting that Mr. Hicks
suggested that the only course left for the
bereaved firm to pursue, if it desired to remain
an aggressive force in its chosen profession, was
to retain the name of Toppleton at the mast-head,
and, as Mr. Mawson put it, "to bluff it
out." Mr. Perkins agreed with Mr. Hicks, and
suggested that the only honest way to do this
was to induce Mr. Toppleton's only son, known
to all&mdash;even to the clerks in the office&mdash;as
Hoppy, to enter the firm as a full partner.</p>

<p>"I do not think," Mr. Perkins said, "that it
is quite proper for us to assume a virtue that
we do not possess, and while Hoppy&mdash;I should
say Hopkins&mdash;has never studied law, I think
he could be induced to do so, in which event
he could be taken in here, and we should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a perfectly equitable claim to all the business
which the name of Toppleton would certainly
bring to us."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Mr. Bronson put in at this
point, "I am very much afraid that such a
course would require the entire reorganization
of the firm's machinery. It would never do
for the member whose name stands at the head
of our partnership designation, to be on such
terms of intimacy with the office boys, for
instance, as to permit of his being addressed by
them as Hoppy; nor would it conduce toward
good discipline, I am convinced, for the nominal
head of the concern to be engaged in making
pools on baseball games with our book-keepers
and clerks, which, during his lamented father's
life, I understand was one of the lad's most
cherished customs. Now, while I agree with
my friend Perkins that it is desirable that the
firm should have an unassailable basis for its
retention of the name of Toppleton, I do not
agree with him that young Hopkins should be
taken in here if we are to retain our present
highly efficient force of subordinates. They
would be utterly demoralized in less than a
month."</p>

<p>"But what do you suggest as an alternative?"
inquired Mr. Morley.</p>

<p>"I believe that we should make Hopkins a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
special partner in the firm, and have him travel
abroad for his health," returned Mr. Bronson
after a moment's reflection.</p>

<p>"I regret to say," objected Mr. Hicks, "that
Hoppy's health is distressingly good. Your
point in regard to the probable demoralization
of our office force, however, is well taken.
Hopkins must go abroad if he becomes one of
us; but I suggest that instead of sending him
for his health, we establish a London branch
office, and put him in charge on a salary of,
say, 10,000 dollars. We have no business
interests outside of this country, so that such a
course, in view of his absolute ignorance of law,
would be perfectly safe, and we could give
Hoppy to understand in the event of his acceptance
of our proposition that he shall be free to
take a vacation whenever he pleases, for as
long a period of time as he pleases, and the
oftener the better."</p>

<p>"That's the best plan, I think," said Mr.
Mawson. "In fact, if Hoppy declines that
responsible office, I wouldn't mind taking it
myself."</p>

<p>And so it happened. The proposition was
made to Hopkins, and he accepted it with
alacrity. He did not care for the practice of
the law, but he had no objection to receiving an
extra ten thousand dollars a year as a silent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
partner in a flourishing concern with headquarters
in London, particularly when his sole
duties were to remain away from the office on a
perpetual vacation.</p>

<p>"I was born with a love of rest," Hoppy once
said in talking over his prospects with his
friends some time before the proposition of his
father's partners had been submitted to him.
"Even as a baby I was fond of it. I remember
my mother saying that I slept for nearly the
whole of my first year of existence, and when I
came to my school days my reputation with my
teachers was, that in the enjoyment of recess
and in assiduous devotion to all that pertained
to a life of elegant leisure, there was not a boy
in school who could approach me."</p>

<p>The young man never railed at fate for compelling
him to lead a life which would have
filled others of robuster ideas with ennui, but
he did on occasions find fault with the powers
for having condemned him to birth in a country
like the United States, where the man of leisure
is regarded with less of reverence than of derision.</p>

<p>"It is a no harder fate for the soul of an
artist to dwell in the body of a pork-packer,"
he had said only the night before the plan outlined
by Mr. Hicks was brought to his attention,
"than for a man of my restful tendencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to be at home in a land where the hustler alone
inspires respect. What the fates should have
done in my case was clearly to have had me
born a rich duke or a prince, whose chief duty
it would be to lead the fashionable world and to
set styles of dress for others to follow. I'd
have made a magnificent member of the House
of Lords, or proprietor of a rich estate somewhere
in England, with nothing to do but to
spend my income and open horse shows; but in
New York there is no leisure class of recognized
standing, excepting, of course, the messenger-boys
and the plumbers, and even they do not
command the respect which foreign do-nothings
inspire. It's hard luck. The only redeeming
feature of the case is that owing to a high tariff
I can spend my money with less effort here than
I could abroad."</p>

<p>Then came the proposition from the firm, and
in it Hoppy recognized the ingredients of the
ideal life&mdash;a life of rest in a country capable of
understanding the value to society of the drones,
a life free from responsibility, yet possessing a
semblance of dignity bound to impress those
unacquainted with the real state of affairs.
Added to this was the encouragement which an
extra ten thousand a year must invariably bring
to the man appointed to receive it.</p>

<p>"It's just what I needed," he said to Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Hicks, "to make my income what it ought to
be. Fifty thousand dollars is, of course, a
handsome return from investments, but it is an
awkward sum to spend. It doesn't divide up
well. But sixty thousand a year is simply ideal.
Twelve goes into sixty five times, and none over&mdash;five
thousand a month means something, and
doesn't complicate accounts. Besides, the
increase will pay the interest on a yacht
nicely."</p>

<p>"You are a great boy, Hoppy," said Mr.
Hicks, when the young man had thus unbosomed
himself, "but I doubt if you will ever
be a great man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Hoppy; "there's
no telling what may develop. Of course, Mr.
Hicks, I shall go into the study of the law very
seriously; I couldn't think of accepting your
offer without making some effort to show that
I deserved it. I shall give up the reading of
my irresponsible days, and take to reading law.
I shall stop my subscription to the sporting
papers, and take the <i>Daily Register</i> and <i>Court
Calendar</i> instead, and if you think it would be
worth while I might also subscribe to the
<i>Albany Law Journal</i>, with which interesting
periodical I am already tolerably familiar,
having kept my father's files in order for some
years."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Hoppy," said Mr. Hicks, with a smile,
"I don't think you'd better give up the sporting
papers; 'all work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Hopkins, in
reply to this. "But I <i>shall</i> read Blackstone,
and accumulate a library on legal subjects, Mr.
Hicks. In that I am firm. I am a good deal
of a book-lover anyhow, and since law is to be
my profession I might as well suit my books to
my needs. I'll order a first edition of Blackstone
at once."</p>

<p>"You'd better get the comic Blackstone,"
said Mr. Hicks, gravely. "You will find it a
very interesting book."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Hicks," returned the
amiable head-partner-elect of the famous legal
firm, "I'll make a note of that. I will also
purchase the 'Newgate Calendar,' and any
other books you may choose to recommend,&mdash;and
I tell you what, Mr. Hicks, when my
collection gets going it will be the talk of the
town. I'll have 'em all in absolute firsts, and
as for the bindings, your old yellow-backed
tomes at the office will be cast utterly in the
shade by my full crushed levant morocco books
in rich reds and blues. Just think of the
hundred or more volumes of New York
reports in Russia leather, Mr. Hicks!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"It takes my breath away, Hoppy," returned
the lawyer. "Every one of the volumes will be
absolutely uncut, I suppose, eh?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind about that," retorted
Hopkins; "you think I'm joking, but you'll
find your mistake some day. I'm serious in this
business, though I think I'll begin my labours
by taking a winter at Nice."</p>

<p>"That is wise," said Mr. Hicks, approvingly;
"and then you might put in the summer in
Norway, devoting the spring and autumn to
rest and quiet."</p>

<p>"I'll think about that," Hopkins answered;
"but the first step to take, really, is to pack up
my things here, and sail for London and secure
an office."</p>

<p>"A very proper sentiment, my dear boy,"
returned Mr. Hicks; "but let me advise you,
do not be rash about plunging into the professional
vortex. Remember that at present
your knowledge of the law is limited entirely
to your theories as to what it ought to be,
and law is seldom that; nor must you forget
that in asking you to represent us in London,
it is not our desire to inflict upon you any
really active work. We simply desire you to
live in an atmosphere that, to one of your
tastes, is necessarily broadening, and if you
find it advisable to pursue intellectual breadth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
across the continent of Europe to the uttermost
parts of the earth, you will find that the
firm stands ready to furnish you with material
assistance, and to remove all obstacles from
your path."</p>

<p>"Thanks for your kindness, Mr. Hicks," said
Hopkins. "I shall endeavour to prove myself
worthy of it."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, my boy," rejoined
Mr. Hicks, rising. "And, in parting with you,
let me impress upon you the importance, both
to you and to ourselves in the present stage
of your legal development, of the maxim,
that to a young lawyer not sure of his law,
and devoid of experience, there is nothing
quite so dangerous as a client. Avoid
clients, Hoppy, as you would dangerous explosives.
Many a young lawyer has seemed
great until fate has thrown a client athwart his
path."</p>

<p>With these words, designed quite as much
for the protection of the firm, as for the edification
of that concern's new head, Mr. Hicks
withdrew, and Hopkins turned his attention to
preparations for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'depature'">departure</ins>; paying his bills,
laying in a stock of cigars, and instructing his
valet as to the disposition of his lares and
penates. Four weeks later he sailed for
London, arriving there in good shape early in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
June, ready for all the delights of the season,
then at its height.</p>

<p>It was not until Hopkins had been four days
at sea, that the firm of Toppleton, Morley,
Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson, Smithers,
and Hicks learned that the new partner had
presided at a Coney Island banquet, given by
himself to the office-boys, clerks, book-keepers,
and stenographers of the firm, on the Saturday
half-holiday previous to his departure. It is
doubtful if this appalling fact would have come
to light even then, had not Mr. Mawson, in
endeavouring to discharge one of the office-boys
for insubordination, been informed by the delinquent
that he defied him; the senior member
of the firm, the departed Hoppy, having
promised to retain the youth in his employ at
increased wages, until he was old enough to
go to London, and assist him in looking after
the interests of his clients abroad. An investigation,
which followed, showed that Hopkins
had celebrated his departure in the manner
indicated, and also divulged the interesting
fact that the running expenses of the office,
according to the new partner's promises, were
immediately to be increased at least twenty-five
per cent. per annum in salaries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MR. HOPKINS TOPPLETON LEASES AN OFFICE.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> did not take Hopkins many days to discover
that a life of elegant leisure in London approximates
labour of the hardest sort. Nor was it
entirely easy for him to spend his one thousand
pounds a month, with lodgings for his headquarters.
This fact annoyed him considerably, for
he valued money only for what it could bring
him, and yet how else to live than in lodgings he
could not decide. Hotel life he abhorred, not
only because he considered its excellence purely
superficial, but also because it brought him in
contact with what he called his "flash-light
fellow countrymen, with Wagnerian voices and
frontier manners"&mdash;by which I presume he
meant the diamond studded individuals who
travel on Cook's Tickets, and whose so-called
Americanism is based on the notion that Britons
are still weeping over the events of '76, and
who love to send patriotic allusions to the star-spangled
banner echoing down through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
corridors of the hotels, out and along the
Thames Embankment, to the very doors of
parliament itself.</div>

<p>"Why don't you buy a house-boat?" asked
one of his cronies, to whom he had confided his
belief that luxurious ease was hard on the
constitution. "Then you can run off up the
Thames, and loaf away the tedious hours of
your leisure."</p>

<p>"That's an idea worth considering," he
replied, "and perhaps I'll try it on next
summer. I do not feel this year, however,
that I ought to desert London, considering the
responsibilities of my position."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said the
other with a laugh. "Responsibilities! Why,
man, you haven't been to your office since you
arrived."</p>

<p>"No," returned Hoppy, "I haven't. In
fact I haven't got an office to 'be to.' That's
what bothers me so like thunder. I've looked
at plenty of offices advertised as for rent
for legal firms, but I'll be hanged if I can find
anything suitable. Your barristers over here
have not as good accommodations as we give
obsolete papers at home. Our pigeon-holes
are palatial in comparison with your office
suites, and accustomed as I am to breathing
fresh air, I really can't stand the atmosphere I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
have been compelled to take into my lungs in
the rooms I have looked at."</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow, what more than a
pigeon-hole do you need?" asked his friend.
"You are not called upon to attend to any
business here. A post-office box would suffice
for the receipt of communications from
America."</p>

<p>"That's all true enough," returned Hopkins,
"but where am I to keep my law library? And
what am I to do in case I should have a
client?"</p>

<p>"Keep your books in your lodgings, and
don't count your clients before they get into
litigation," replied the other.</p>

<p>"My dear Tutterson," Hopkins said in
answer to this, "you are the queerest mixture
of common sense and idiotcy I have ever encountered.
My library at home, indeed!
Haven't you any better sense than to suggest
my carrying my profession into my home life?
Do you suppose I want to be reminded at
every step I take that I am a lawyer? Must
my business be rammed down my throat at all
hours? Am I never to have relaxation from
office cares? Indeed, I'll not have a suggestion
of law within a mile of my lodgings! I
must have an office; but now that I think of it,
not having to go to the office from one year's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
end to another, it makes no difference whether
it consists of the ground floor of Buckingham
Palace or a rear cell three flights up, in Newgate
Prison."</p>

<p>"Except," returned Tutterson, "that if you
had the office at Newgate you might do more
business than if you shared Buckingham
Palace with the Royal family."</p>

<p>"Yes; and on the other hand, the society
at the palace is probably more desirable than
that of Newgate; so each having equal
advantages, I think I'd better compromise and
take an office out near the Tower," said Hopkins.
"The location is quite desirable from
my point of view. It would be so inaccessible
that I should have a decent excuse for not
going there, and besides, I reduce my chances
of being embarrassed by a client to a minimum."</p>

<p>"That is where you are very much mistaken,"
said Tutterson. "If you hang your
shingle out by the Tower, you will be one
lawyer among a hundred Beef-Eaters, and
therefore distinguished, and likely to be sought
out by clients. On the other hand, if you
behave like a sensible man, and take chambers
in the Temple, you'll be an unknown attorney
among a thousand Q.C's. And as for the decent
excuse for not attending to business, you simply
forget that you are no longer in America but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
England. Here a man needs an excuse for
going to work. Trade is looked down upon.
It is the butterfly we esteem, not the grub. A
man who <i>will</i> work when he doesn't need to
work, is looked upon with distrust. Society
doesn't cultivate him, and the million regard
him with suspicion,&mdash;and the position of both
is distinctly logical. He who serves is a servant,
and society looks upon him as such, and when
he insists upon serving without the necessity to
serve, he diminishes by just so much the opportunities
of some poor devil to whom opportunity
is bread and butter, which sets the poor devil
against him. You do not need an excuse for
neglecting business, Toppleton, and, by Jove, if
it wasn't for your beastly American ideas, you'd
apologize to yourself for even thinking of such
a thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I fancy you are right," replied
Toppleton. "To tell you the truth, I never
thought of it in that light before. There is
value in a leisure class, after all. It keeps the
peach-blow humanity from competing with the
earthenware, to the disadvantage of the latter.
I see now why the lower and middle classes so
dearly love the lords and dukes and other noble
born creatures Nature has set above them.
It is the generous self-denial of the aristocracy
in the matter of work, and the consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
diminution of competition, that is the basis of
that love. I'll do as you say, and see what I
can do in the Temple. Even if a client should
happen to stray in at one of those rare moments
when I am on duty, I can assume a weary
demeanour and tell him that I have already
more work on my hands than I can accomplish
with proper deference to my health, and request
him to take his quarrel elsewhere."</p>

<p>So the question was settled. An office was
taken in the Temple. Hopkins bought himself
a wig and a gown, purchased a dozen tin boxes,
each labelled with the hypothetical name of
some supposititious client, had the room
luxuriously fitted up, arranged his law library,
consisting of the "Comic Blackstone," "Bench
and Bar," by Sergeant Ballantyne, the
"Newgate Calendar," and an absolute first of
"Parsons on Contracts," on the mahogany
shelves he had had constructed there; hung
out a shingle announcing himself and firm as
having headquarters within, and, placing beneath
it a printed placard to the effect that he had
gone out to lunch, he turned the key in the
door and departed with Tutterson for a trip to
the land of the Midnight Sun.</p>

<p>Now it so happened, that the agent having in
charge the particular section of the Temple in
which Hopkins' new office was located, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
concealed from the young American the fact
that for some twenty-five or thirty years, the
room which Toppleton had leased had remained
unoccupied&mdash;that is, it had never been occupied
for any consecutive period of time during that
number of years. Tenants had come but had
as quickly gone. There was something about
the room that no one seemed able to cope with.
Luxuriously furnished or bare, it made no
difference in the fortunes of Number 17, from
the doors of which now projected the sign of
Toppleton, Morley, Harkins, Perkins, Mawson,
Bronson, Smithers, and Hicks. Just what the
trouble was, the agent had not been able to
determine in a manner satisfactory to himself
until about a year before Hopkins happened in
to negotiate with him for a four years' lease.
Departing tenants, when they had spoken to
him at all on the subject, had confined themselves
to demands for a rebate on rents paid in
advance, on the rather untenable ground that
the room was uncanny and depressing.</p>

<p>"We can't stand it," they had said, earnestly.
"There must be some awful mystery connected
with the room. There has been a murder, or a
suicide, or some equally dreadful crime committed
within its walls at some time or
another."</p>

<p>This, of course, the agent always strenuously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
denied, and his books substantiated his denial.
The only possible crime divulged by the books,
was thirty-three years back when an occupant
departed without paying his rent, but that
surely did not constitute the sort of crime
that would warrant the insinuation that the
room was haunted.</p>

<p>"And as for your statement that the room
makes you feel weird and depressed," the agent
had added with the suggestion of a sneer, "I
am sure there is nothing in the terms of the
lease which binds me to keep tenants in a
natural and cheerful frame of mind. I can't
help it, you know, if you get the blues or eat
yourselves into a state that makes that room
seem to you to be haunted."</p>

<p>"But," one expostulating tenant had observed,
"but, my dear sir, I am given to understand
that the five tenants preceding my
occupancy left for precisely the same reason,
that the office at times is suffocatingly weird;
and that undefined whispers are to be heard
playing at puss in the corner with heart-rending
sighs at almost any hour of the day or night
throughout the year, cannot be denied."</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to say about that," was
the agent's invariable reply, "is that <i>I</i> never
saw a sigh or heard a whisper of a supernatural
order in that room, and if you want to go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
law with a case based on a Welsh rarebit diet,
just do it. If the courts decide that I owe you
money, and must forfeit my lease rights because
you have dyspepsia, I'll turn over the whole
business to you and join the army."</p>

<p>Of course this independent attitude of the
agent always settled the question at once.
His tenants, however insane they might appear
to the agent's eyes, were invariably sane enough
not to carry the matter to the courts, where it
was hardly possible that a plaintiff could be
relieved of the conditions of his contract,
because his office gave him a megrim, super-induced
by the visit of a disembodied sigh.</p>

<p>Judges are hard-headed, practical persons,
who take no stock in spirits not purely liquid,
realizing which the tenants of Number 17, without
exception, wisely resolved to suffer in silence,
invariably leaving the room, however, in a state
of disuse encouraging to cobwebs, which would
have delighted the soul of a connoisseur in
wines.</p>

<p>"If I can't make the rent of the room, I can
at least raise cobwebs for innkeepers to use in
connection with their wine cellars," said the
agent to himself with a sad chuckle, which
showed that he was possessed of a certain
humorous philosophy which must have been
extremely consoling to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of three years of abortive effort to
keep the room rented, impelled partly by
curiosity to know if anything really was the
matter with the office, partly by a desire to
relieve the building of the odium under which
the continued emptiness of one of its apartments
had placed it, the agent moved into
Number 17 himself.</p>

<p>His tenancy lasted precisely one week, at the
end of which time he moved out again. He,
too, had heard the undefined whispers and disembodied
sighs; he, too, had trembled with
awe when the uncanny quality of the atmosphere
clogged up his lungs and set his heart
beating at a galloping pace; he, too, decided
that so far as he was concerned life in that
office was intolerable, and he acted accordingly.
He departed, and from that moment No. 17
was entered on his books no longer as for rent
as an office, but was transferred to the list of
rooms mentioned as desirable for storage purposes.</p>

<p>To the agent's credit be it said that when
Hopkins Toppleton came along and desired to
rent the apartment for office use his first impulse
was to make a clean breast of the matter,
and to say to him that in his own opinion and
that of others the room was haunted and had
been so for many years; but when he reflected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that his conscience, such as it was, along with
the rest of his being, was in the employ of the
proprietors of the building, he felt that it was
his duty to hold his peace. Toppleton had
been informed that the room was useful chiefly
for storage purposes, and if he chose to use it
as an office, it was his own affair. In addition
to this, the agent had a vague hope that Hopkins,
being an American and used to all sorts of
horrible things in his native land&mdash;such as boa-constrictors
on the streets, buffaloes in the back
yard, and Indians swarming in the suburbs of
the cities,&mdash;would be able to cope with the invisible
visitant, and ultimately either subdue or
drive the disembodied sigh into the spirit vale.
In view of these facts, therefore, it was not surprising
that when Hopkins had finally signed a
four years' lease and had taken possession, the
agent should give a sigh of relief, and, on his
return home, inform his wife that she might
treat herself to a new silk dress.</p>

<p>During the few weeks which elapsed between
the signing of the lease and Hopkins' ostensible
departure on a three months' lunching tour, he
was watched with considerable interest by the
agent, but, until the "Gone to Lunch" placard
was put up, the latter saw no sign that Hopkins
had discovered anything wrong with the office,
and even then the agent thought nothing about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
it until the placard began to accumulate dust.
Then he shook his head and silently congratulated
himself that the rent had been paid a year
in advance; "for," he said, "if he hasn't gone
to New York to lunch, the chances are that that
sigh has got to work again and frightened him
into an unceremonious departure." Neither of
which hypotheses was correct, for as we have
already heard, Hopkins had departed for Norway.</p>

<p>As for the sigh, the young lawyer had heard it
but once. That was when he was about leaving
the room for his three months' tour, and he had
attributed it to the soughing of the wind in the
trees outside of his window, which was indeed
an error, as he might have discovered at the
time had he taken the trouble to investigate,
for there were no trees outside of his window
through whose branches a wind could have
soughed even if it had been disposed to do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MR. HOPKINS TOPPLETON ENCOUNTERS A WEARY SPIRIT.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was well along in October when Hopkins
returned to London, and he got back to his
office in the Temple none too soon. The agent
had fully made up his mind that he was gone
for good, and was about taking steps to remove
his effects from Number 17, and gain an honest
penny by sub-letting that light and airy apartment
for his own benefit, a vision of profit which
Toppleton redivivus effectually dispelled.</div>

<p>The return, for this reason, was of course a
grave disappointment to Mr. Stubbs, but he
rose to the occasion when the long lost lessee
appeared on the scene, and welcomed him
cordially.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," he said. "Glad to see
you back. Didn't know what had become of
you or should have forwarded your mail. Have
a pleasant trip?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very," said Toppleton, shortly.</p>

<p>"It seems to have agreed with you,&mdash;you've
a finer colour than you had."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hopkins, drily. "That's
natural. I've been to Norway. The sun's
been working day and night, and I'm
tanned."</p>

<p>"I hope everything is&mdash;er&mdash;everything was
all right with the room, sir?" the agent then
said somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>"I found nothing wrong with it," said Hopkins;
"did you suspect that anything was wrong
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!&mdash;indeed not. Of course not," returned
the agent with some confusion. "I
only asked&mdash;er&mdash;so that in case there was
anything you wanted, you know, it might be
attended to at once. There's nothing wrong
with the room at all, sir. Nothing. Absolutely
nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good," said Toppleton, turning
to his table. "I'm glad there's nothing the
matter. It will take a very small percentage
of the rental to remedy that. Good morning,
Mr. Stubbs."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said Mr. Stubbs, and
then he departed.</p>

<p>"Now for the mail," said Hopkins, grasping
his letter-opener, and running it deftly through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the flap of a communication from Mr. Morley,
written two months previously.</p>

<p>"Dear Hoppy," he read. "We have just
been informed of your singular act on the
Saturday previous to your departure for
London."</p>

<p>"Hm! what the deuce did I do then?"
said Hopkins, stroking his moustache thoughtfully.
"Let me see. 'Singular act.' I've
done quite a number of singular things on
Saturdays, but what&mdash;Oh, yes! Ha, ha!
That Coney Island dinner. Oh, bosh!&mdash;what
nonsense! as if my giving the boys a feast
were going to hurt the prospects of a firm like
ours. By George, it'll work just the other way.
It'll fill the force with an enthusiasm for work
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Hopkins stopped for a moment to say,
"Come in!" Somebody had knocked, he
thought. But the door remained closed.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he cried again.</p>

<p>Still there was no answer, and on walking to
the door and opening it, Toppleton discovered
that his ears had deceived him. There was no
one there, nor was there any sign of life whatever
in the hallway.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," he said, returning to his chair
and taking up Mr. Morley's letter once more.
"It might have been a client, and to a man at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the head of a big firm who has never been
admitted to practice in any court or country,
that would be an embarrassment to say the
least. It's queer though, about that knock. I
certainly heard one. Maybe there is some
telepathic influence between Morley and me.
He usually punctuates his complaints with a
whack on a table or back of a chair. That's
what it must have been; but let's see what else
he has to say."</p>

<p>"Of course," he read, "if you desire to
associate with those who are socially and
professionally your inferiors, we have nothing
to say. That is a matter entirely beyond our
jurisdiction, but when you commit the firm to
outrageous expenditures simply to gratify your
own love of generosity, it is time to call a
halt."</p>

<p>"What the devil is he talking about?" said
Hopkins, putting the letter down. "I paid
for that dinner out of my own pocket, and
never charged the firm a cent, even though it
does indirectly reap all the benefits. I'll have
to write Morley and call his attention to that
fact. How vulgar these disputes&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point he was again interrupted by a
sound which, in describing it afterwards, he
likened to a ton of aspirates sliding down a
coal chute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"This room appears to be an asylum for
strange noises," said he, looking about him to
discover, if possible, whence this second interruption
came. "I don't believe Morley feels
badly enough about my behaviour for one of
his sighs to cross the ocean and greet my ears,
but I'm hanged if I know how else to account
for it, unless there's a speaking tube with a
whistle in it somewhere hereabouts. I wonder
if that's what Stubbs meant!" he added,
reflecting.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he said in answer to his own question,
picking up Mr. Morley's letter for a third
time. "This is the nineteenth century. Weird
sounds are mortal-made these days, and I'm
not afraid of them. If there were anything
supernatural about them, why didn't the air
get blue, and where's my cold chill and my hair
standing erect? I fancy I'll retain my composure
until the symptoms are a little more
strongly developed."</p>

<p>Here he returned to his reading.</p>

<p>"We desire to have you explain to us, at your
earliest convenience," the letter went on to say,
"why you have so extravagantly raised the
salary of every man, woman and child in our
employ, utterly regardless of merit, and without
consultation with those with whom you have
been associated, to such a figure that the firm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
has been compelled to reduce its autumn dividend
to meet the requirements of the pay roll.
Your probable answer will be, I presume,&mdash;knowing
your extraordinary resources in the
matter of explanations&mdash;that you cannot consent
to be a mere figure-head, and that you
considered it your duty to impress upon our
clerks the fact that you are not what they might
suspect under the circumstances, but a vital,
moving force in the concern; but you may as
well spare yourself the trouble of making any
such explanation, since it will not be satisfactory
either to myself or to the other members
of the firm, with the possible exception of our
friend Mawson, who, with his customary about-town
manners, is disposed to make light of the
matter. We desire to have you distinctly
understand that your duties are to be confined
entirely to the London office, and to add that
were it not for your esteemed father's sake we
should at once cancel our agreement with you.
The name you bear, honoured as it is in our
profession, is of great value to us: but it is,
after all, a luxury rather than a necessity, and
in these hard times we are strongly inclined
to dispense with luxuries whenever we find
them too expensive for our pockets."</p>

<p>Hopkins paused in his reading and pursed
his lips to give a long, low whistle, a sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which was frozen <i>in transitu</i>, for the lips were
no sooner pursed than there came from a far
corner the very sound that he had intended to
utter.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Toppleton knew
what fear was; for the first time since he was
a boy, when he wore it that way, did he
become conscious that his hair stood upon end.
His blood seemed to congeal in his veins, and
his heart for a moment ceased to beat, and
then, as if desirous of making up for lost time,
began to thump against his ribs at lightning
pace and with such force that Hopkins feared
it might break the crystal of the watch which
he carried in the upper left-hand pocket of his
vest.</p>

<p>Mr. Morley's letter fluttered from his nerveless
hand to the floor, and, despite its severity,
was forgotten before it touched the handsome
rug beneath Hopkins' table. The new sensation&mdash;the
sensation of fear&mdash;had taken possession
of his whole being, and, for an instant, he
was as one paralyzed. Then, recovering his
powers of motion, he whirled about in his revolving
chair and started to his feet as if he
had been shot.</p>

<p>"This is unbearable!" he cried, glancing nervously
about the room. "It's bad enough to
have an office-boy who whistles, but when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
get the whistle in the abstract without the
advantage of the office-boy, it is too much."</p>

<p>Then Hopkins rang the bell and summoned
the janitor.</p>

<p>"Tell the agent I want to see him," he said
when that worthy appeared, and then, returning
to his desk, he sat down and mechanically
opened a copy of the <i>Daily Register</i> and tried
to read it.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he cried in a moment, crumpling
the paper into a ball and throwing it across
the room. "That vile whistle has regularly
knocked me out."</p>

<p>The paper ball reached the door just as the
agent entered, and struck him athwart the
watch chain.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," said Hopkins, "I didn't mean
that for you. Everything here seems to be bewitched
this morning, that dull compilation of
legal woe included."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence, sir, I assure you,"
returned the agent uneasily.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think it amounts to a row of
beans to a man who hates trouble," said Hopkins,
referring more to the journal than to the
untoward act of the paper ball. "But I say,
Mr. Stubbs, I've been having a devil of a time
in this room this morning, and when I say devil
I mean devil."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Stubbs paled visibly. The moment he had
feared had come.</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;what sus&mdash;seems to b&mdash;be the
m&mdash;mum&mdash;matter, sir?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Nothing seems, something <i>is</i> the matter,"
returned Hopkins. "I don't wonder you
stammer. You'd stammer worse if you had
been here with me three minutes ago. Stubbs,
I believe this room is haunted!"</p>

<p>Mr. Stubbs's efforts at surprise at this point
were painful to witness.</p>

<p>"Haunted, sir?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, haunted!" retorted Hopkins; "and by
a confoundedly impertinent something or other
that not only sighs and knocks on the door but
whistles, Stubbs&mdash;actually whistles. Has this
room a history?"</p>

<p>"Well, a sort of a one," returned Stubbs;
"but I never heard any one complain about it
on the score of whistling, sir."</p>

<p>"Stubbs, I believe you are lying. Hasn't
somebody killed an office-boy in this apartment,
for whistling?" queried Hopkins, gazing sternly
at the shuffling agent.</p>

<p>"I'll take an affidavit that nothing of the kind
ever happened," returned the agent, gaining
confidence.</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary," said Toppleton.
"I am satisfied with your assurance. But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Stubbs, to what do you attribute these beastly
disturbances? Ghosts?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, Mr. Toppleton," replied Mr.
Stubbs. "I fancy you must have heard some
boy whistling in the hall."</p>

<p>"How about the knock and the sigh?" demanded
the American.</p>

<p>"The knock is easily accounted for," returned
the agent. "Somebody in the room
above you must have dropped something on the
floor, while the sigh was probably the wind
blowing through the key-hole."</p>

<p>"Or a bit of fog coming down the chimney,
eh, Stubbs?" put in Hopkins, satirically.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied poor Stubbs, growing red
where he had been white; "there is no fog to-day,
sir."</p>

<p>"True, Stubbs; and you will likewise observe
there is no wind to sough through key-holes,"
retorted Hopkins, severely, rising and walking
to the window.</p>

<p>Stubbs stood motionless, without an answer.
Toppleton had cornered him in a flimsy pretext,
and then came the climax to his horrible experience.</p>

<p>From behind him in the corner whence had
come the sigh and the whistle, there now proceeded
a smothered laugh&mdash;a sound which
curdled his blood and left him so limp that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
staggered to the mantel and grasped it to keep
himself from falling to the floor.</p>

<p>Hopkins turned upon him, his face livid with
anger, and the two men gazed at each other in
silence for a moment, the one endeavouring to
master his fear, the other to smother his
wrath.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me, Mr. Stubbs, by
laughing in my face when I send for you to
request explanations as to the conduct&mdash;as to
the&mdash;er&mdash;the conduct of your room? It sounds
ridiculous to say that, but there is no other way
to put it, for it <i>is</i> the conduct of the room of
which I complain. What do you mean by your
ill-timed levity?"</p>

<p>"I pass you my word, Mr. Toppleton, I will
swear to you, sir, that nothing was further from
my thoughts than mirth. I agree with you that
it is no laughing matter for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I heard you laugh," said Toppleton,
eyeing the agent, his anger now not unmixed
with awe. "You laughed as plainly as it is
possible for any one to laugh, except that you
endeavoured to smother the sound."</p>

<p>"I did nothing of the sort, Mr. Toppleton,"
pleaded Stubbs, his hand shaking and his eyes
wandering fearsomely over toward the mysterious
corner where all was still and innocent-looking.
"That laugh came from other lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
than mine&mdash;if, indeed, it came from lips at all,
which I doubt."</p>

<p>"You mean," cried Toppleton, grasping
Stubbs by the arm with a grip that made the
agent wince, "you mean that this room is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Khee-hee-hee-hee-hee!" came the derisive
laugh from the corner, followed by the mysterious
whistle and heartrending sigh which
Hopkins had already so unpleasantly heard.</p>

<p>Toppleton was transfixed with terror, and
the agent, with an ejaculation of fear, ran from
the room, and scurried down the stairs out into
the court as fast as his legs could carry him,
where he fell prostrate in a paroxysm of terror.</p>

<p>Deserted by the agent and shut up in the
room with his unwelcome visitor&mdash;for the agent
had slammed the door behind him with such
force that the catch had slipped and loosened
the bolt, so that Toppleton was to all intents
and purposes a prisoner&mdash;Hopkins exerted what
little nerve force he had left, and pulled himself
together again as best he could. He staggered
to his table, and taking a small bottle of whiskey
from the cupboard at its side, poured at least
one half of its fiery contents down into his
throat.</p>

<p>"<i>Similia similibus</i>," said he softly to himself.
"If I have to fight spirits, I shall use
spirits." Then facing about, he gazed into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
corner unflinchingly for a moment, following up
his glance with one of the hand fire grenades
that hung in a wire basket on the wall, which he
hurled with all his force into the offending void.
To this ebullition of heroic indignation, the only
reply was a repetition of the sounds whose
origin was so mysterious, but this time they
proceeded directly from Toppleton's chair
which stood at his side.</p>

<p>Another grenade, smashed into the maroon
leather seat of the chair, was Hopkins'
rejoinder, whereupon he was infuriated to
hear the smothered laugh emanate from the
depths of a treasured bit of cloisonn&eacute; standing
upon the mantel, within which it had been
Hopkins' custom, in his apartments at home,
to keep the faded leaves of the roses given to him
by his friends of the fairer sex&mdash;a custom which,
despite the volumes of tobacco smoke poured
into the room by Hopkins and his companions
night and day, kept the atmosphere thereof as
sweet as a garden.</p>

<p>"You are a bright spirit," said Hopkins with
a forced laugh. "You know mighty well that
you are safe from violence there; but if you'll
get out of that and give me one fair shot at you
over on the washstand, you'll never haunt
again."</p>

<p>"At last!" came the smothered voice, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
time from the top of the jar. "At last, after
years of weary waiting and watching, I may
speak without breaking my vow."</p>

<p>"Then for heaven's sake," cried Hopkins,
sinking back into his chair and staring blankly
at the jar, "for heaven's sake speak and
explain yourself, if you do not wish to drive me
to the insane asylum. Who in the name of
my honoured partners are you?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, and then the
answer came,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am a weary spirit&mdash;a spirit in exile&mdash;harmless
and unhappy, whose unhappiness you
may be able to relieve."</p>

<p>"I?" cried Hopkins, wildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you. I am come to intrust my affairs
to your hands."</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A client," returned the spirit.</p>

<p>Hopkins gasped twice, closed his eyes,
clutched wildly at his heart, and slid down
to the floor an inert mass.</p>

<p>He had fainted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WEARY SPIRIT GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">How</span> long Hopkins would have remained in an
unconscious state had not a cold perspiration
sprung forth from his forehead, and, trickling
over his temples, brought him to his senses, I
cannot say. Suffice it to relate that his stupor
lasted hardly more than a minute. When he
opened his eyes and gazed over toward the
haunted vase, he saw there the same depressing
nothingness accompanied by the same soul-chilling
sighs that had so discomfited him. To
the ear there was something there, a something
quite as perceptible to the auricular sense as if
it were a living, tangible creature, but as imperceptible
to the eye as that which has never
existed. The presence, or whatever else it
was that had entered into Toppleton's life so
unceremoniously, was apparently much affected
by the searching gaze which its victim directed
toward it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></div>

<p>"Don't look at me that way, I beg of you,
Mr. Toppleton," said the spirit after it had
sighed a half dozen times and given an occasional
nervous whistle. "I don't deserve all
that your glance implies, and if you could only
understand me, I think you would sympathize
with me in my trials."</p>

<p>"I? I sympathize with you? Well, I like
that," cried Toppleton, raising himself on his
elbow and staring blankly at the vase. "It
appears to me that I am the object of sympathy
this time. What the deuce are you, anyhow?
How am I to understand you, when you sit
around like a maudlin void lost in a vacuum?
Are you an apparition or what?"</p>

<p>"I am neither an apparition nor a what,"
returned the spirit. "I couldn't be an apparition
without appearing. I suppose you might
call me a limited perception; that is, I can be
perceived but not seen, although I am human."</p>

<p>"You must be a sort of cross between a
rumour and a small boy, I suppose; is that
it?" queried Toppleton, with a touch of sarcasm
in his tone.</p>

<p>"If you mean that I am half-way between
things which should be seen and not heard, and
other things which should be heard and not
seen, I fancy your surmise approximates
correctness. For my part, a love of conciseness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
leads me to set myself down as a Presence,"
was the spirit's answer.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a liberal reward," retorted
Toppleton, eagerly, "if you'll place yourself in
the category of an Absence as regards me and
my office here; for, to tell you the truth, I am
addicted more or less to heart disease, and I
can't say I care to risk an association with a
vocally inclined zero, such as you seem to be.
What's your price?"</p>

<p>"You wrong me, Toppleton," returned the
Presence, indignantly, floating from the edge
of the vase over to the large rocking chair in
the corner by the window, which began at once
to sway to and fro, to the undisguised wonderment
of its owner. "I am not a blackmailer, as
you might see at once if you could look into
my face."</p>

<p>"Where do you keep your face?" asked
Hopkins, sitting up and embracing his knees.
"If you have brought it along with you for
heaven's sake trot it out. I can't ruin my eyes
on you as you are now. Have you no office
hours, say from ten to two, when you may be
seen by those desirous of feasting their eyes
upon your tangibility?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are joking, Hopkins," said
the spirit, growing familiar. "If you are, I beg
that you will stop. What is a good joke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to some eyes is a very serious matter to
others."</p>

<p>"That, my dear Presence," returned Toppleton,
"is a very true observation, as is borne out
by the large percentage of serious matter that
appears in comic journals."</p>

<p>"Please do not be flippant," said the voice
from the rocking-chair, sadly. "I have come
to you as a suppliant for assistance. The
fact that I have come without my body is
against me, I know, but that is a circumstance
over which I have absolutely no control. My
body has been stolen from me, and I am at
present a shapeless wanderer with nowhere to
lay my head, and no head to lay there, if perchance
the world held some corner that I
might call my own."</p>

<p>"I can't see what you have to complain
about on that score," said Toppleton, rising
from the floor and seizing a large magnifying
glass from his table and gazing searchingly
through it into the chair which still rocked
violently. "An individual like yourself, if you
are an individual, ought to be able to find
comfort anywhere. The avidity with which you
have seized upon that chair, and the extraordinary
vitality you seem to have imparted to its
rockers, indicate to my mind that the world
has about everything for you that any reasonable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
being can desire. If you can percolate
into my apartment and make use of the luxuries
I had fondly hoped were exclusively mine, I
can't see what is to prevent your settling down
at Windsor Castle if you will. Aren't there
any comfortable chairs and beds there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether there are or not,"
replied the Presence. "I never went there, and
being a loyal British Presence, I should hesitate
very strongly before I would discommode the
Royal family."</p>

<p>"It might be awkward, I suppose," returned
Toppleton with a laugh, "if you should happen
to fall asleep in the Prince of Wales' favourite
arm-chair, and he should happen to come in
and sit on you, for I presume you are no more
visible to Royalty than you are to Republican
simplicity as embodied in myself. Still, as a
loyal British subject, I should think you'd
rather be sat on by the Prince than by a
common mortal."</p>

<p>As Hopkins spoke these words the chair
stopped rocking, and if its attitude meant anything,
its invisible occupant was leaning forward
and staring with pained astonishment at the
young lawyer, who was leaning gracefully against
the mantelpiece. Then on a sudden the chair's
attitude was relaxed and it rocked slowly backward
again, resuming its former pace. A few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
minutes passed without a word being spoken,
at the end of which time the spirit sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>"Is there anything in this world," it asked,
"is there anything too sacred for you
Americans to joke about? Have you no ideals,
no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plenty of ideals but no special idols,"
returned Hopkins, perceiving the spirit's drift.
"But of course, if I hurt your feelings by joking
about the Prince, I apologize. Though unasked,
you are still my guest, and I should be very
sorry to seem lacking in courtesy. But tell
me about this body of yours. How did you
come to lose it, and is it still living?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is still living," replied the spirit.
"Living a life of honoured ease."</p>

<p>"But how the deuce did you come to lose it?
that's what I can't understand. I have heard
of men losing pretty nearly everything but their
bodies."</p>

<p>"As I have already told you," said the spirit,
wearily, "it was stolen from me."</p>

<p>"And have you no clue to the thieves? Do
you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know where it is. In fact I saw it
only last week," replied the spirit with a sob,
"and it's getting old, Toppleton, very old.
When it was taken away from me it was erect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of stature, broad-shouldered, muscular and full
of health. To-day it is round-shouldered, flabby
and generally consumptive-looking. When I
occupied it, the face was clean-shaven and
ruddy. The hair was of a rich auburn, the
hands milk white. The carriage was graceful,
and about my lips there played a smile that
fascinated. The blue eyes sparkled, the teeth
shone out between my lips when I smiled, like a
strip of chased silver in the sunlight; I tell you,
Toppleton, when I had that body it had some
style about it; but now&mdash;it breaks my heart to
think of it now!"</p>

<p>"It hasn't lost its good looks altogether, has
it?" queried Hopkins, his voice slightly tremulous
with the sympathy he was beginning to
feel for this disembodied entity before him.</p>

<p>"It has," sobbed the spirit; "and I'm not
surprised that it has, considering the life it has
led since I lost it. The auburn hair that used
to be my mother's pride, and my schoolmates'
source of wit, has gradually dropped away and
left a hairless scalp of an insignificant pinkish
hue which would disgrace a shrimp. My once
happy smile has subsided into something like a
toothless sneer; for my dazzling teeth are no
more. The blue eyes are expressionless, the
elastic step is halting, and, what is worse, the
present occupant of my physical self has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
grown a beard that makes me look like a
pirate."</p>

<p>"I wonder you recognized yourself," said
Hopkins.</p>

<p>"It was strange; but I did recognize myself
by my ring which I still wear," returned the
spirit. "But, Toppleton," it added, "you have
no notion how terrible it is for a man to see
himself growing old and breaking away from all
the habits and principles of youth, powerless to
interfere. For instance, my body was temperate
when I was in it. I never drank more
than one glass of whiskey in one day. Now it
is brandy and water all day long, and it galls me,
like the merry hereafter, with my temperance
scruples, to see myself given over to intemperate
drams. <i>I</i> never used profane language. Last
Friday I heard my own lips condemn a poor unoffending
fly to everlasting punishment. But I
want to tell you how this outrageous thing came
to pass. I want to tell you how it was that in the
very bud of my existence I was robbed of a suitable
case in which to go through life, and I want
you, with your extraordinary knowledge of the
law, as I understand it to be, to devise some
scheme for my relief. If you don't, nobody will,
and before many years it will be too late. The
body is growing weaker every day. I can see
that, and I want to get it back again before it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
becomes absolutely valueless. I believe that
under my care, restored to its original owner, it
can be fixed up and made quite respectable for
its declining years. Of course the teeth and the
hair are gone for ever, but I think I can furbish
up the smile, the eye and the hands. I know
that I can restore my former good habits."</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I see how I can help you,"
rejoined Hopkins. "Do you mean to say that
the present occupant of your personality is the
creature who robbed you of it?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the spirit. "He's the
very same person, and, stars above us, how he
has abused the premises! He has made my
name famous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that he took your
name too?" put in Hopkins incredulously.</p>

<p>"I mean just that," retorted the spirit. "He
stole my name, my body, my prospects, my
clothing&mdash;every blessed thing I had except my
consciousness, and he thrust that out into a
cold, unsympathetic world, to float around in
invisible nebulousness for thirty long years.
Oh, it is an awful tale of villainy, Toppleton!
Awful!"</p>

<p>"You say he has made your name famous,"
said Toppleton. "You give him credit for that,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I would if the very fame accorded my name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
did not tend to make me infamous in the eyes
of those I hold most dear; and the beastly part
of it is that I can't explain the situation to
them."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Hopkins. "If you can
lay all this misery bare to me, why can't you
lay it before those for whose good will and
admiration you are lamenting?"</p>

<p>"Because, Hopkins, they never address me,
and it is my hard fate not to be able to open a
conversation," returned the spirit. "If you will
remember, it was not until you asked me who
the devil I was, or some equally choice question
of like import, that I began to hold converse
with you; you are the only man with whom I
have talked for thirty years, Hopkins, because
you are the only person who has taken the
initiative."</p>

<p>"Well, you goaded me into it," returned
Hopkins. "So I can't see why you can't goad
your friends of longer standing into it."</p>

<p>"The explanation is simple," replied the
spirit. "My friends haven't had the courage
to withstand the terrors of the situation. The
minute I have whistled, sighed or laughed, they
have made a bee line for the door, and raised
such a hullabaloo about the 'supernatural visitation,'
as they termed my efforts, that I
couldn't do a thing with them. They've everyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of them, from my respected mother down,
avoided me, even as that man Stubbs has
avoided me. I believe you too would have fled
if the door hadn't locked automatically, and so
forced you to remain here."</p>

<p>"If I could have avoided this interview I
should most certainly have done so," said
Toppleton, candidly. "You can probably
guess yourself how very unpleasant it is to
be disturbed in your work by a whistle that
emanates from some unseen lips, and to have
your room taken possession of by an invisible
being with a grievance."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hopkins. I've had almost the same
experience myself," replied the spirit; "and to
be as candid with you as you have been with
me, I will say that it was just that experience,
and nothing else, that is responsible for my
present difficulties."</p>

<p>"That's encouraging for me," said Hopkins,
nervously. "But tell me how have you become
infamously famous?"</p>

<p>"The bandit who now occupies my being
has violated every principle of religion and
politics that he found in me when he took possession,"
returned the spirit, leaving the rocking-chair
and settling down on the mantelpiece,
in front of the clock. "Where I was a pronounced
Tory he has made me vote with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Liberals. Notwithstanding the fact that I was
brought up in the Church of England, he joined
first the dissenters and is now a thorough
agnostic, and signs my name to the most
outrageous views on social and moral subjects
you ever heard advanced. My family have cut
loose from me as I am represented by him, and
the dearest friend of my youth never mentions
my name save in terms of severest reprehension.
Would you like that, Hopkins Toppleton?"</p>

<p>"I'd be precious far from liking it," Hopkins
answered. "It seems to me I'd commit suicide
under such circumstances. Have you thought
of that?"</p>

<p>"Often," replied the spirit; "but the question
has always been, how?"</p>

<p>"Take poison! Shoot yourself! Drown
yourself!"</p>

<p>"I can't take poison. That fiend who
robbed me has my stomach, so what could I
put the poison into?" retorted the spirit.
"Shoot myself? How? I haven't a pistol.
If I had a pistol I couldn't fire it, because I've
nothing to pull the trigger with. If I had
something to pull the trigger with, what should
I fire at? I have no brains to blow out, no
heart to shoot at. I'd simply fire into air."</p>

<p>"How about the third method?" queried
Toppleton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Drowning?" asked the unhappy Presence.
"That wouldn't work. I've nothing to drown.
If I could get under water, I'd bubble right up
again, so you see it's useless. Besides, it's only
the body that dies, not the spirit. You see the
shape I'm left in."</p>

<p>"No," returned Hopkins, "I perceive the
lack of shape you are left in, and I must confess
you are in the hardest luck of any person I ever
knew; but really, my dear sir, I don't see how
I can render you any assistance, so we might
as well consider the interview at an end. Now
that I am better acquainted with you I will say,
however, that if it gives you any pleasure to loll
around here or to sleep up there in my cloisonn&eacute;
jar with the rose leaves, you are welcome to do
so."</p>

<p>"If you would only hear my story, Hopkins,"
said the spirit, beseechingly, "you would be so
wrought up by its horrible details that you
would devise some plan for my relief. You
would be less than a man if you did not, and I
am told that you Americans are great fighters.
Take this case for me, won't you?"</p>

<p>Hopkins hesitated. He was strongly inclined
to yield, the cause was so extraordinary, and
yet he could not in a moment overcome his
strongly-cultivated repugnance to burdening
himself with a client. Then he was conscientious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
too. He did not wish to identify the
famous house of Toppleton, Morley, Harkins,
Perkins, Mawson, Bronson, Smithers and
Hicks with a case in which the possibilities of
success seemed so remote. On the other hand
he could not but reflect that, aside from the
purely humane aspect of the matter, a successful
issue would redound to the everlasting
glory of himself and his partners over the sea&mdash;that
is, it would if anybody could be made to
believe in the existence of such a case. He
realized that the emergency was one which
must be met by himself alone, because he was
thoroughly convinced that the hard-headed
practical men of affairs whom he represented
would scarcely credit his account of the occurrences
of the last hour, and would set him down
either as having been under the influence of
drink or as having lost his senses. He would
not have believed the story himself if some one
else had told it to him, and he could not expect
his partners in New York to be any more
credulous than he would have been.</p>

<p>His hesitation was short-lived, however, for
in a moment it was dispelled by a sigh from his
unseen guest. It was the most heartrending
sigh he had ever heard, and it overcame his
scruples.</p>

<p>"By George!" he said, "I will listen to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
story, and I'll help you if I can, only you will
unstring my nerves unless you get yourself a
shape of some kind or other. It makes my
blood run cold to sit here and bandy words
with an absolute nonentity."</p>

<p>"I don't know where I can get a shape," returned
the spirit.</p>

<p>"What did the thief who took your shape do
with his old one?" asked Hopkins.</p>

<p>"He'd buried it before I met him," returned
the spirit.</p>

<p>"Buried it? Oh, Heavens!" cried Hopkins,
seizing his hat. "Let's get out of this and
take a little fresh air; if we don't, I'll go mad.
Come," he added, addressing the spirit, "we'll
run over to the Lowther Arcade and buy a form.
If we can't find anything better we'll get a
wooden Indian or a French doll, or anything
having human semblance so that you can climb
into it and lessen the infernal uncanniness of
your disembodiment."</p>

<p>Hopkins rang the janitor's bell again, and
when that worthy appeared he had him unfasten
the door from the outside; then he and the
spirit started out in search of an embodiment
for the exiled soul.</p>

<p>"Hi thinks as 'ow 'e must be craizy," said
the janitor, as Toppleton disappeared around
the corner in animated conversation with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
invisible client. "E's' talkin' away like hall
possessed, hand nobody as hi can see within
hearshot. These Hamericans is nothink much
has far as 'ead goes."</p>

<p>As for Toppleton and the Presence, they
found in the Lowther Arcade just what they
wanted&mdash;an Aunt Sallie with a hollow head,
into which the spirit was able to enter, and
from which it told its tale of woe, sitting,
bodily and visibly, in the rocking-chair, before
the eyes of Hopkins Toppleton, the words
falling fluently from the open lips of the dusky
incubus the spirit had put on.</p>

<p>"It was odd, but not too infernally weird,"
said Hopkins afterwards, "and I was able to
listen without losing my equanimity, to one of
the meanest tales of robbery I ever heard."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOPKINS BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE WEARY SPIRIT.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">I do</span> not know," said the weary spirit, as he
entered the head of the Aunt Sallie and
endeavoured to make himself comfortable
therein, "I do not know whether I can do
justice to my story in these limited headquarters
or not, but I can try. It isn't a good
fit, this body isn't, and I cannot help being
conscious that to your eyes I must appear as a
blackamoor, which, to an English spirit of
cultivation and refinement such as I am, is
more or less discomfiting."</div>

<p>"I shouldn't mind if I were you," returned
Hopkins. "It's very becoming to you; much
more so, indeed, than that airy nothingness
you had on when I first perceived you, and
while your tale may be more or less affected by
your consciousness of the strange, ready-made
physiognomy you have assumed, I, nevertheless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
can grasp it better than I might if you persisted
in sounding off your woes from an empty
rocking-chair, or from the edge of my cloisonn&eacute;
rose jar."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't blame you, Toppleton,"
returned the spirit. "I am, on the contrary,
very grateful to you for what you have done
for me. I shall always appreciate your
generosity, for instance, in buying me this
shape in order to give me at least a semblance
of individuality, and I assure you that if I can
ever get back into my real body, I will work it
to the verge of nervous prostration to serve you,
should you stand in need of assistance in any
way."</p>

<p>Hopkins' scrutiny of the Aunt Sallie, as these
words issued from the round aperture in the
red lips made originally to hold the pipe stem,
but now used as a tubal exit for the tale of woe,
was so searching that anything less stolid than
the wooden head would have flinched. The
Aunt Sallie stood it, however, without showing
a trace of emotion, gazing steadfastly with her
bright blue eyes out of the window, her eyelids
more fixed than the stars themselves, since no
sign of a wink or a twinkle did they give.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Toppleton, experiencing a
slight return of his awed chilliness as he observed
the unyielding fixity of Sallie's expression,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
"in fact, I earnestly wish we could have
secured a ventriloquist's marionette instead of
that thing you've got on. It would really be a
blessing to me if you could wink your eyes, or
wag your ears, or change your expression in
some way or other."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can be done," returned
the spirit from behind Toppleton's back. "I
cannot exercise any control over these wooden
features."</p>

<p>Hopkins jumped two or three feet across the
room, the unexpected locality of the voice gave
him such a shock, and the pulsation of his
heart leaped madly from the normal to the
triply abnormal.</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;whuh&mdash;what the devil did you do
tha&mdash;that for?" he cried, as soon as he was
calm enough to speak. "Do y&mdash;you want to
give me heart failure?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" replied the spirit, once more
returning to the Sallie. "That would be a
very unbusiness-like proceeding on my part at
a time like this, when, after thirty years of
misery, I find at last one who is willing to
champion my cause. I only wanted to see how
my second self looked in this chair. To my
eyes I appear rather plain and dusky-looking,
but what's the odds? The figure will serve
its purpose, and after all that's what we want.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I'm sorry to have frightened you, Toppleton,
honestly sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," rejoined Toppleton,
graciously. "Only don't do it again. Let's
have the tale now."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the spirit. "If you will
kindly shove me further back into the chair,
and arrange my overskirt for me, I'll begin&mdash;that's
another uncomfortable thing about my
situation at present. It's somewhat trying to
a spirit of masculine habits to find himself
arrayed in a shape wearing the habiliments of
the other sex."</p>

<p>Hopkins did as he was requested, and, throwing
himself down on his lounge, lit his pipe, and
announced himself as ready to listen.</p>

<p>"I think I'd like a pipe myself," said the
Sallie. "I've got a fine place for one, I see."</p>

<p>"How can you talk if you stop your mouth
up with a pipe?" asked Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Through my nose," replied the spirit. "Or
there are holes in the ears, I can talk through
them quite as well."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not," returned Hopkins. "I
have had enough of your weird vocal exercises
to-day without having you talk with your ears,
but if you'll smoke with one or both of them,
you're welcome to do it."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the spirit. "I fancy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
you're right, and inasmuch as I haven't had a
pipe for thirty years, I'll let you fill up two for
me, and I'll try 'em both."</p>

<p>Accordingly Hopkins filled two of the clay
pipes, three dozen of which had come with the
Aunt Sallie, and lighting them for the spirit,
placed them in the ears of his vis-&agrave;-vis as
requested.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the spirit as he began to puff,
"this is what I call comfort." And then he
began his story.</p>

<p>"I was born," he said, breathing forth a
cloud of smoke from his right ear, "sixty years
ago in a small house within a stone's throw of
what is now the band stand in the park at
Buxton."</p>

<p>"You must have had human catapults in
those days," interrupted Toppleton, for as he
remembered the band stand at Buxton, it
was situated at some considerable distance from
anything which in any degree represented a
habitation in which one could begin life comfortably.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. I am not telling
you a sporting tale. I am simply narrating
the events of my career, such as they are,"
returned the spirit, "and my father has assured
me that the house in which I first saw light
was, as I have said, within a stone's throw of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
what is now the band stand in the Buxton Park.
The band stand may have been nearer the
house in the old days than it is now,&mdash;that is an
insignificant sort of a detail anyhow, and if
you'd prefer it I will put it in this way: I was
born at Buxton sixty years ago in a small house,
no longer standing, from whose windows the
band stand in the park might have been seen
if there had been one there. How is that?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly satisfactory," replied Hopkins.
"A statement of that kind would be accepted
in any court in the land as veracious on the
face of it, whereas we might be called upon to
prove that other tale, which between you and
me had about it a distinctly Munchausenesque
flavour."</p>

<p>The spirit was evidently much impressed
with this reasoning, for he forgot himself for a
moment, and inhaled some of the smoke, so that
it came out between his lips instead of from his
ears as before.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you take such interest in
the matter," he said after a moment's reflection.
"We must indeed have an absolutely <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'irrefragible'">irrefragable</ins>
story if we are to take it to court. I
had not thought of that. But to resume. My
parents were like most others of their class,
poor but honest. My mother was a poetess
with an annuity. My father was a non-resistant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a sort of forerunner of Tolsto&iuml;, with none of the
latter's energy. He was content to live along
on my mother's annuity, leaving her for her own
needs an undivided interest in the earnings of
her pen."</p>

<p>"He was a gentleman of leisure, then,"
returned Hopkins, "with pronounced leanings
towards the sedentary school of philosophy."</p>

<p>"That's it," replied the spirit. "That was
my father in a nut-shell. He took things as
they came&mdash;indeed that was his chief fault. As
mother used to say, he not only took things as
they came, but took all there was to take, so
that there was never anything left for the rest
of us. His non-resistant tendencies were
almost a curse to the family. Why, he'd even
listen to mother's poetry and not complain. If
there were weeds in the garden, he would submit
tamely, rather than take a hoe and eradicate
them. He used to sigh once in awhile and
condemn my mother's parents for leaving her
so little that she could not afford to hire a man
to keep our place in order, but further than
this he did not murmur. My mother, on the
other hand, was energetic in her special line.
I've known that woman to turn out fifteen
poems in a morning, and, at one time, I think it
was the day of Victoria's coronation, she wrote
an elegy on William the Fourth of sixty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stanzas, and a coronation ode that reached
from one end of the parlour to the other,&mdash;doing
it all between luncheon and dinner. Dinner
was four hours late to be sure, but even that
does not affect the wonderful quality of the
achievement."</p>

<p>"Didn't your father resist that?" queried
Toppleton, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No," replied the spirit, "never uttered a
complaint."</p>

<p>"He must have been an extraordinary man,"
observed Toppleton, shaking his head in
wonder.</p>

<p>"He was," assented the spirit. "Father
was a genius in his way; but he was born tired,
and he never seemed able to outgrow it."</p>

<p>Here the spirit requested Toppleton's permission
to leave the Aunt Sallie for a moment.
The head was getting too full of smoke for
comfort.</p>

<p>"I'll just sit over here on the waste basket
until the smoke has a chance to get out," he
said. "If I don't, it will be the ruin of me."</p>

<p>"All right," returned Toppleton. "I suppose
when a man is reduced to nothing but a
voice, it is rather destructive to his health to
get diluted with tobacco smoke. But, I say,
that was a pretty tough condition of affairs in
your house I should say. Poetic mother, do-nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
father, small income and a baby. How
did you manage to live?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we lived well enough," replied the
spirit. "The income was large enough to pay
the rent and keep father from hunger and thirst&mdash;particularly
the latter. Mother, being a poet,
didn't eat anything to speak of, and I fed on
cow's milk. We had a cow chiefly because
her appetite kept the grass cut, and when I
came along she served an additional useful purpose.
In the matter of clothing we did first
rate. Mother's trousseau lasted as long as she
did, and father never needed anything more
than the suit he was married in. Inheriting
my mother's poetic traits, and my father's tendency
to let things come as they might and go
as they would, it is hardly strange that as I
grew older I became addicted to habits of indecision;
that I lacked courage when a slight
display of that quality meant success; that I
was invariably found wanting in the little crises
which make up existence in this sphere; that
I always let slip the opportunities which were
mine, and that at those tides of my own affairs
which taken at the flood would have led on to
fortune, I was always high and dry somewhere
out of reach, and that, in consequence, all the
voyage of my life has been bound in shallows and
in miseries, as my mother would have said."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother must have been a diligent
student of Shakespeare," Toppleton retorted,
resenting the spirit's appropriation to his
mother of the great singer's words, and also
taking offence at the implied reflection upon
his own reading.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was," replied the spirit unabashed.
"In fact, my mother was so saturated&mdash;she was
more than imbued&mdash;with the spirit of Shakespeare,
that she was frequently unable to distinguish
her own poems from his, a condition
of affairs which was the cause, at one time, of
her being charged with plagiarism, when she
was in reality guilty of nothing worse than unconscious
cerebration."</p>

<p>"That is an unfortunate disease when it
develops into verbatim appropriation," said
Toppleton, drily.</p>

<p>"Precisely my father's words," returned the
spirit. "But the effect of such parental causes,
as I have already said," continued the exiled
soul, "was a pusillanimous offspring, which
for the offspring in question, myself, was
extremely disastrous. The poet in me was just
sufficiently well developed to give me a malarious
idea of life. In spite of my sex I was a
poetess rather than a poet. I could begin an
epic or a triolet without any trouble; but I
never knew when to stop, a failing not necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fatal to an epic, but death to a triolet.
The true climaxes of my lucubrations were
generally avoided, and miserably inadequate
compromises adopted in their stead. My muse
was a snivelling, weak-kneed sort of creature,
who, had she been of this earth, would have
belonged to the ranks of those who are addicted
to smelling-salts, influenza and imaginary
troubles, and not the strong, picturesque, helpful
female, calculated to goad a man on to
immortality. I generally knew what was the
right thing to do, but never had the courage to
do it. That was my peculiarity, and it has
brought me to this&mdash;to the level of a soul with
no habitation save the effigy of a negress, provided
for me by a charitably disposed chance
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"You do not appear to have had a single
redeeming feature," said Toppleton, some disgust
manifested on his countenance, for to tell
the truth he was thoroughly disappointed to
learn that the spirit's moral cowardice had
brought his trouble upon him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I had," replied the spirit hastily,
as if anxious to rehabilitate himself in his
host's eyes. "I was strong in one particular.
In matters pertaining to religion I was unusually
strong. My very meekness rendered me so."</p>

<p>"Your kind of meekness isn't the kind that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
inherits the earth, though," retorted Toppleton.
"Meekness that means the abandonment of
right for the sake of peace is a crime. Meekness
that subverts self-respect is an offence
against society. Meekness which is synonymous
with pusillanimity is not the meekness
which develops into true religious feeling."</p>

<p>"No; that is very true," said the spirit. "I
do not deny one word of what you say; but I,
nevertheless, was an extremely religious boy,
nor did I change when I entered upon man's
estate; and it is that strong religious fervour
with which my spirit is still imbued that has
made my cup so much the more bitter, since,
as I have hinted, he who robbed me of
my body has written pamphlets of the most
shocking sort over my name, denouncing the
Church and attempting to upset the whole fabric
of Christianity."</p>

<p>"I am anxious to get to the details of the
robbery," said Toppleton, with a smile of sympathy;
"pass over your extreme youth and
come to that."</p>

<p>"I will do so," replied the spirit, returning
to the figure Toppleton had provided for him,
the smoke having by this time evacuated his
new habitation. "I will omit the details of my
life up to the time when I became a lawyer
and&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you <i>ever</i> became a
lawyer?" interrupted Hopkins, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," replied the spirit; "I
became a lawyer, and at the time I lost my
body I was getting to be considered a famous
one."</p>

<p>"How on earth, with your meekness, did you
ever have the courage to take up a profession
that requires nerve and an aggressive nature if
success is to be sought after?" asked the
American.</p>

<p>"It was that same fatal inability to make up
my mind to do what my conscience prompted.
It was another one of my compromises," returned
the spirit, sadly. "I couldn't make up
my mind between the pulpit and literature, so
I compromised on the law, mastered it to a
sufficient extent to be admitted to practice, and
opened an office&mdash;the same room, by the way,
as that in which you and I are seated at this
moment."</p>

<p>"Do you remember any of your law now?"
Toppleton asked uneasily, for he was afraid the
spirit might discover how ignorant he was on
the subject.</p>

<p>"Not a line of it," returned the spirit. "It
has gone from me as completely as my name,
my body, my auburn hair and my teeth. But
I <i>was</i> a lawyer, and by slow degrees I built up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a fair practice. People seemed to recognize
how strong I was in matters of compromise,
and cases that were not considered strong
enough to take into court were brought to me
in order that I might suggest methods of
adjustment satisfactory to both parties. For
three years I did a thriving business here, and
for one whose knowledge of the law was limited
I got along very well. I was one of the few
barristers in London who had become well-known
to litigants without ever having appeared
in court, and I was very well satisfied with my
prospects.</p>

<p>"Everything went smoothly with me until a
few weeks after I had passed my thirtieth
birthday, when a man came into my office and
retained me in an inheritance case, in which
the amount involved was thirty thousand
pounds. He had been made defendant in a
suit brought against him by his own brother
for the recovery of that sum. It was a very
complicated case, but the brother really had no
valid claim to the money. The father of the
two men, ten minutes before his death, had told
my client in confidence that it was his desire
that he should inherit sixty thousand pounds
more than the other brother, telling him, however,
that he must get it for himself, since the
written will of the dying man provided that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
two sons should share and share alike. In spasmodic
gasps the old man added that he would
find the money concealed in a secret drawer in
an old desk up in the attic, in sixty one-thousand
pound notes. My client, realizing that his father
could not last many minutes longer, and feeling
that his dying wishes should not be thwarted,
rushed from the room to the attic, and after
rummaging about for nine minutes, found the
drawer and touched the secret spring. Unfortunately
the day was a very damp one, and
the drawer stuck, so that it was fully eleven
minutes before the money was really in my
client's hands. He shoved it into his pocket
and went downstairs again, where he learned
that his father had expired one minute before,
or just ten minutes after he had left him.</p>

<p>"The other son not long after discovered what
had been done, and after listening to my client's
story, decided to contest his title to his share
of the sixty thousand pounds, alleging that the
money not having passed into my client's hands
until after the testator's death, belonged to the
estate, and could only be diverted therefrom
upon the production of an instrument in writing
over the deceased man's signature, duly witnessed.
You see," added the spirit, "that was
a very fine point."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Toppleton; "it's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
kind of a point that I hope and pray may never
puncture my professional epidermis, for I'll be
hanged if I'd know what to advise. What did
you do?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the spirit, "there's where the
trouble came in. I studied that case diligently.
I consulted every law book I could find. Every
leading case on inheritance matters I read,
marked, learned and inwardly digested, and I
made up my mind that if we could prove that
my client's watch was fast upon that occasion,
and that the money was in his hands one minute
before his father's death instead of one minute
after it, the plaintiff would not have a leg to
stand on. Then it occurred to me 'this means
trouble.' It means a long and tedious litigation.
It means defeat, appeal, victory, appeal,
defeat, appeal, on, on through all the courts in
Great Britain, and finally the House of Lords,
the result being the loss to my client of every
penny of the amount involved, even though he
should ultimately win the suit, and the loss to
me of sleep, the development of nerves and a
career of unrelieved anxiety. Compromise was
the proper course to be recommended."</p>

<p>"A proper conclusion, I should say," said
Toppleton.</p>

<p>"I think so, too," replied the spirit, "and if
I had only remained true to my instincts my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
client would have compromised, and I should
have been spared all that followed. It would
have been better for all concerned, for I should
have been in possession of myself to-day, and
my client by compromising would in the end
have lost no more than he had to pay me for
my services&mdash;fifteen thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Phe&mdash;e&mdash;ew!" whistled Hopkins. "That
was a swindle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wasn't party to it, as you will
shortly see. When I made up my mind that
compromise was the best settlement of the
case, all things considered, I sat down right
here by this window to write to Mr. Baskins to
that effect. It was a beastly night out. The
wind shrieked through the court there, and it was
cold enough to freeze the marrow in a grilled
bone. I was just about to sign my communication
to Mr. Baskins, when I heard a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>"'Come in,' I said.</p>

<p>"And then, Mr. Toppleton, as sure as I am
sitting here in this Aunt Sallie talking to you,
the door opened and then slowly closed, a light
step was perceptible to the ear, moving across
the carpet, and in a moment a rocking-chair
owned by me began to sway to and fro, just as
this one sways when I or you are sitting in it,
but to my eyes there was absolutely nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
visible that had not always been in the
room."</p>

<p>Hopkins began to feel chilly again.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that to all intents and
purposes, an invisible being like yourself called
on you as you have called on me?" he said in
a minute, his breath coming in short, quick
gasps.</p>

<p>"Precisely," returned the incumbent of the
Aunt Sallie. "I was visited, even as you have
been visited, by an invisible being, only my
visitor did not remain invisible, for as I sprang
to my feet, my whole being palpitant with
terror, the lamp on my table sputtered and
went out; and then I saw, sitting luminous in
the dark, gazing at me with large, gaping, unfathomably
deep green eyes, a creature having
the semblance of a man, but of a man no longer
of this earth."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SPIRIT UNFOLDS A HORRID TALE.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">If</span> ever a man had a right to swoon away,
Hopkins," continued the spirit, his voice dropping
to a whisper, "I was that man, and I presume
I should have done so but for the everlasting
spirit of compromise in my breast. The
proper thing to do under the circumstances
was manifestly to flop down on the carpet
insensate, just as you did when I announced
myself to you; and I assure you I had greater
reason for so doing than you had, for my visitor
had absolutely no limitations whatsoever in the
line of the horrible. He was an affront to every
sense, and not, like myself, trying only to the
ear. To the sense of sight was he most
horrible, and I would have given anything I
possessed to be able to remove my eyes from
his dreadful personality, with the long bony
claws where you and I have fingers; with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tight-drawn cheeks so transparent that through
them could be seen his hideous jaws; with
eyes which stared even when the lids closed
over them; and, worst of all, his throbbing
brain was visible as it worked inside his skull;
and so bloodless of aspect was he withal, that
the mind instinctively likened him to a fasting
vampire."</div>

<p>"Excuse me!" groaned Hopkins, throwing
himself down on the couch and burying his
face in the pillow. "This is awful. I've
crossed the ocean eight times, Sallie, and
until now I have never known sea-sickness,
but this&mdash;this vampire of yours is mightier
than Neptune; just hand me the whiskey."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it affects you that way, Hopkins,"
said the spirit, "and I'd gladly give you the
whiskey if I could, but you know how circumscribed
my abilities are. I haven't any hand to
hand it with."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Hopkins, the colour
returning to his cheeks, "I feel better now. It
was only a sudden turn I had; only, my friend,
go slow on the horrible, will you?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could," replied the spirit sadly,
"but the cause of truth requires that I tell you
precisely what happened, omitting no single
detail of the sickening totality. Perhaps,
before I proceed, you had better take a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
grains of quinine, and have the whiskey within
reach."</p>

<p>"That is a good suggestion," said Hopkins,
rising and gulping down the pills, and grasping
the neck of the square-cut bottle containing the
treasured fluid, with his trembling hand. "Go
ahead," he said, as he resumed his recumbent
position on the couch.</p>

<p>"To the olfactories," resumed the spirit,
"the visitant was stifling. A gross of sulphur
matches let off all at once would be a weak
imitation of the atmospheric condition of this
room after he had been here two minutes, and
yet I did not dare to turn from him to open the
window. My only weapon of defence was my
eye, under the tense gaze of which he seemed
uneasy, and I was fearful of what might happen
were I to permit it to waver for one instant.
His colour was simply deadly. I should describe
it best, perhaps, as of a pallid green in which
there was a suggestion of yellow that heightened
the general effect to the point where it became
ghastly."</p>

<p>Here Hopkins' eyelids fluttered, and the
bottle was raised to his lips. When the
draught had been taken the bottle dropped
from his nerveless fingers to the floor, and
shivered into countless slivers of brown
crystal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jove!" ejaculated the spirit. "That was
very unfortunate, Hop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter," interrupted Hopkins, "it was
empty. Go on. Did this private view you
and the Nile-green apparition were having of
each other last for ever?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the spirit, "it did not. It
probably lasted less than a minute, although it
seemed a century. I tried half a dozen times
to speak, but my words were frozen on my
lips."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you break them off and throw
them at him?" suggested Toppleton, hysterical
to the point of flippancy.</p>

<p>"Because I did not possess the genius of
the Yankee who is inventive where the Briton
is only enduring," retorted the spirit, somewhat
disgusted at Toppleton's airy treatment
of his awful situation. "Finally my visitor
spoke, and for an instant I wished he hadn't,
his voice was so abominably harsh, so jangling
to every nerve in my body, however
callous."</p>

<p>"'You don't appear to be glad to see me,' he
said.</p>

<p>"'Well, to tell you the truth,' I replied, 'I
am not. I am not a collector of optical
delusions, nor am I a lover of the horrible and
mysterious.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But I am your friend,' remonstrated my
visitor.</p>

<p>"'I should dislike to be judged by my
friends, if that is so,' I returned, throwing as
much withering contempt into my glance as I
possibly could. 'I think,' I resumed, 'if I
were to be seen walking down Piccadilly with
you, I should be cut by every self-respecting
acquaintance I have.'</p>

<p>"'You are an ungrateful wretch,' said the
intruder. 'Here I have travelled myriads of
miles to help you, and the minute I put in an
appearance you cast worse slurs upon me than
you would if I were your worst enemy.'</p>

<p>"'I do not wish to be ungrateful,' I answered
coolly, 'but you must admit that it
is difficult for a purely mortal being like myself
to receive a supernatural being like yourself
with any degree of cordiality.'</p>

<p>"'Granted,' returned the spectre with a
grin, which was more terrifying to me than
anything I had yet seen, 'but when I tell you
that I have come to befriend you&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I don't call it friendly to scare a man
to death; I don't call it friendly to steal
invisibly into a man's office and choke him
nearly to suffocation. It seems to me you
might use some other style of cologne to
advantage when you go calling on your friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and if I had cheeks through which my whole
molar system was visible to the outside world,
I'd grow whiskers.'"</p>

<p>"My admiration for you has increased
eighty-seven per cent.," put in Toppleton,
"that is, it has if all you say you said to the
spook is true."</p>

<p>"I'd swear to it," returned the spirit, the
tone of his voice showing the gratification he
felt at Toppleton's words. "I talked up to
him all the time, though I was quaking inwardly
from the start. He noticed it too, for he
said practically what you have just remarked.</p>

<p>"'You command my highest admiration,'
were his words. 'If you were as spunky as
this all the time, you would not need my
assistance, but you are not, and so I have come.
<i>You must not compromise that case.</i>'</p>

<p>"Here the deadly green thing rose from the
chair and approached me," continued the
spirit, "and as he approached my terror
increased, so it is no wonder that, when he
got so near that I could feel his wretched soul-chilling
breath upon my cheek, his luminous
body towering above me as a giant towers over
a dwarf, and repeated the words, '<i>you must not
compromise that case</i>,' I should shrink back
into a heap at the side of my desk, and reply,
'Certainly <i>not</i>.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You have a splendid fighting chance,' he
added, 'but it will be a bitter fight,&mdash;a fight,
the winning of which will make you famous,
but which you, by yourself, with all the law in
Christendom on your side, could no more win
than you could batter down the Tower of
London with balls of putty.'</p>

<p>"'Then,' said I, 'I <i>must</i> compromise.'</p>

<p>"'No,' returned my visitor, 'for I am here
to win the case for you.'</p>

<p>"'You will never be retained,' I retorted.
'You are a degree too foggy to be acceptable
either to my client or to myself.'</p>

<p>"'I do not ask to be retained; but you must
provide me with the means to appear in court.
<i>You must leave your body and let me put it on.</i>'"</p>

<p>"That must have been a staggerer," said
Hopkins. "Were you fool enough to give it
to him without getting a receipt?"</p>

<p>"I was not fool enough to yield without persuasion,"
rejoined the spirit sadly, "but when
he brought all the infernal power at his command
into play to lure me on, I weakened, and
when I weaken I am done for. Toppleton,
that messenger of Satan promised me everything
that was dear to my soul. The temptation
of Faust was nowhere alongside of that
which was placed before me as mine if I but
chose to take it, and no price was asked save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that one little privilege of being permitted to do
the things which should make me rich, powerful
and happy in the guise which I was to put off
that the apparition might put it on. From my
boyhood days I had wished to be rich and
powerful, and from the hour in which I reached
man's estate had I been in love, but hopelessly,
since she I loved was ambitious, and would not
consent to be mine until I had made my mark.</p>

<p>"'Alone,' said my visitor, 'you will never
make your name illustrious. With my help
you may&mdash;and consider what it means. Refuse
my offer, and you will lead the dull, monotonous
life of him who knows no success, to whose
ears the plaudits of the world shall never come;
you will live alone and uncared for, for she
whom you love cannot become the wife of a
failure. Accept my offer, and in a month you
are famous, in a year you are rich, in an instant
you are happy, for the heart you yearn
toward will beat responsive to your own.'</p>

<p>"'But your motive!' I cried. 'Why should
you do all this for me who know you not, and
without a price?'</p>

<p>"'My reason,' returned that perjured instrument
of malign fate, 'is my weakness. I love
the world. I love the sensation of living. I
love to hear the praises of man ringing in my
ears. I am a lover of earth and earthly ways,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with no hope of tasting the joys of earth save
in your acquiescence. I am the soul of one
departed. I have put off against my will the
mortal habitation in which I dwelt for many
happy years. I have solved the rebus of existence
and have put on omniscience. All things I can
accomplish once I have the means. I ask you
for them, with little hope that you will grant
my request, however, because you are the embodiment
of all that is uncertain. Had you
lived among the Olympian gods, they would
have made you the Deity of Indecision; but
before refusing my offer remember this, you
have now the grand opportunity of life, such an
opportunity as has never been offered to any
mortal being since the time of Shakespeare&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Did Shakespeare have this opportunity?'
I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"'My son,' returned the apparition, with a
meaning look, 'do not seek to know too much
about the mystery of William Shakespeare.
You know whence he sprang, how he lived and
what he achieved; let my unguarded words of
a moment since be the seed of suggestion which
planted in the soil of your brain may sprout
and blossom forth into the flowers of certain
knowledge. It is not for me to let a mortal
like you into the confidence of the Fates; suffice
it that <i>I</i> offer you immortality and present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
happiness. Think it over: I will return to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"Before I could reply," continued the spirit,
"he had vanished. The light of my lamp returned
of its own volition, and but for the odour
of sulphur which still clung to the hangings of
the room I should have supposed that I had
been dreaming.</p>

<p>"Utterly wearied by the excitement of my
strange experience, I threw myself down upon
my couch, and fell into a deep sleep from which
I did not awake for sixteen hours, in consequence
of which a whole day was practically
gone out of my life.</p>

<p>"Darkness was closing in upon me as I
opened my eyes, and as it grew more dense I
could see taking shape in the chair by my table
my visitor of the night before, more pallid and
sulphurous than ever.</p>

<p>"'Well?' he said, as I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>"'No!' I answered shortly, 'I am not well.
I might be much better if you'd confine yourself
to the cemetery to which you belong.'</p>

<p>"'Reparteedious as ever!' he retorted.</p>

<p>"'I don't know the word,' I replied; 'it belongs
to neither a dead nor a live language.'</p>

<p>"'But it's a good word, nevertheless,' observed
the ghost quietly,' and I advise you to
think of it whenever you are inclined to indulge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in stupid repartee. It may help you in your
career,&mdash;but I have come for an answer to my
proposition.'"</p>

<p>"He was right about reparteedious," said
Hopkins, interrupting the spirit's story; "that's
a good word, and unless you have it copyrighted
I think I'll open the doors of my vocabulary
and admit it to the charmed circle of my
verbiage."</p>

<p>"No, I have no copyright on it," replied the
spirit, gazing at Hopkins with as sad an expression
as could possibly be assumed, considering
the imperturbability of Aunt Sallie's
countenance. "You may have it for your
vocabulary, Hopkins, but if you will take a little
well-meant advice you had better be very
careful about your word collection. Your
frequent and flippant interruptions of my sad
story lead me to fear that you are overworking
your vocabulary, which is a very dangerous
thing for a young man of your age and intelligence
to do.</p>

<p>"But to resume my tale," continued the
spirit, after waiting a moment for Hopkins to
reply to his suggestion, which Hopkins seemed
not to hear, so busy was he looking for his
memorandum book on his table,&mdash;a table so
littered up with papers and silver paraphernalia
for writing that no portion of its polished surface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was visible. "I told my unwelcome guest that
I had no answer to give him; that, as I was
not a believer in the supernatural, I did not
intend to waste my time in parleying with a
figment of my brain.</p>

<p>"'You are cautious enough to have been a
policeman,' he said in response to this. 'But
caution in this instance is a vice.'</p>

<p>"'Caution is not a vice when a spirit of your
evil aspect enters one's office in the dead of
night, and asks for the loan of one's body,' I
answered. 'I should be more justified in lending
my diamond-stud to a sneak thief to wear
to a lawn-tennis party at the Duke of Devonshire's,
than in acquiescing in your scheme.'</p>

<p>"'Then you do not care to become a great
man, to assure yourself of a fortune beyond
your wildest dreams, to put yourself in such a
position that she whom you love will be unable
to resist your proposal of marriage?'</p>

<p>"'I am not untruthful enough to make
any such pretence as that,' I answered. 'I
do want to be everything you say, to have
everything that you promise, but if I know the
young woman upon whom my affections are
lavishing themselves, she would object strenuously
to my making a bargain with a transparent
offshoot of the infernal regions like yourself.
How do I know that, after I am married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and have settled down to a life of honourable
ease, you will not come along and insist upon
an invitation to dinner; or obtrude yourself
into the home circle at times when it will be
extremely inconvenient to receive you? What
guarantee have I that, when I have suddenly
developed from my present obscurity into
the promised distinction, you will not appear
to some of my rivals and let them into the
secret of my success; and, more important
still, how do I know that after Miss Hicksworthy-Johnstone
has become my wife you
will not go to her and destroy my happiness
by revealing to her the true state of affairs?'</p>

<p>"'I can only give you my word that I will
be faithful,' returned my visitor.</p>

<p>"'Well, if your word is no better than
reparteedious, it is not the kind of word upon
which I should place any reliance whatsoever,'
I retorted; 'so you may as well take yourself
off; I am not lending myself these days.'"</p>

<p>"That was very well said," observed Toppleton,
"only I wish you had had witnesses.
Your sudden development of back-bone under
the circumstance was so extraordinarily extraordinary
that it is almost beyond credence.
Did the fiend depart as you spoke those
words?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the exiled spirit, "he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
not. He began operations, deceiving me
grossly. He rose from the rocking-chair
and said he fancied it was time for him to be
off. When he got to the door he turned and
kissed his right collection of claws to me,
and asked if there was any place in the
neighbourhood where he could get a drink.
Well, of course, unpleasant as he was to
look at, he had injured me in no respect,
and save for my instinctive suspicions I had
no real reason for believing that he was
actuated by any but the best of motives.
So I replied that the best place I knew of
for him to get a drink was right here in
this room, and that if he would wait a
second I would join him in a glass. He
hesitated an instant, and then said that seeing
it was I who asked him, he thought he would;
so I got out my little stone jug and poured
out two rather stiff doses of brandy. Now
it had been my habit to take my liquid refreshment
undiluted, and taking my glass in hand I
held it aloft and observed, 'Here's to you.'</p>

<p>"My visitor placed his claws on my arm.</p>

<p>"'You do not mean to say,' he said, 'that
you take this fiery stuff without water?'</p>

<p>"'That is my custom,' I answered. 'I think
it a positive wrong to spoil good brandy with
the rather inferior brand of water we get here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
London, nor do I deem it proper to take so pure
a fluid as water and destroy its innocence by
introducing this liquid into it.'</p>

<p>"'As you please,' was my visitor's response.
'I was foolish enough to do that myself when I
was fortunate enough to have a physique. In
fact it was just that thing that finally laid me
by the heels. But let me have a little water
with mine please.'</p>

<p>"I laid my glass down beside his on the table,
and, taking the pitcher, left the room for an instant
to fill it at the water-cooler."</p>

<p>"That was a fine thing to do," said Toppleton.
"Your idiocy cropped out then in great shape.
How did you know he wouldn't rob you?"</p>

<p>"I wish he had robbed me and gone about
his business," returned the spirit. "If that
was all he did, I'd have been all right to this
day. I was gone about two minutes, and when
I returned he was standing by the window,
whistling the most obnoxious tune I ever
heard. What it was I don't know, but it gave
me a chill. As I entered the room he stopped
whistling and turned to greet me, took the
pitcher from my hand, filled his glass to the
brim with water and quaffed its contents. I
drank my dose raw. As the brandy coursed
down my throat into my stomach I fairly
groaned with pain, it burned me so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What the devil have you been doing with
that brandy?' I cried, turning upon my
visitor.</p>

<p>"'Swallowing it; why?' he asked innocently.
'You meant that I should drink it,
didn't you?'</p>

<p>"'You can't put me off that way,' I groaned
in my agony; for if I had swallowed a hot coal
I could not have suffered more, that infernal
stuff scorched me so. 'You have drugged my
brandy.'</p>

<p>"'Have I?' he asked, with a menacing
gesture and a frown that wrinkled up his
hideous forehead, until his brains, still visible
through the transparent flesh and bone, were
reduced to a spongy mass no bigger than a
walnut&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was concentrating his mind, I suppose?"
suggested Hopkins.</p>

<p>"It looked that way," said the spirit, "and
it was an awful sight.</p>

<p>"'Have I?' he repeated, and then he added,
'well, if I have, it is only to save you from
yourself, for by this means alone can you ever
fulfil your destiny.'</p>

<p>"As these words issued forth from his white
lips, I became unconscious. How long I
remained so, I do not know; but when I
came to once more, I was as I am now&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
spirit having no visible shape; while seated
in my chair, writing with my pen and in
perfect imitation of my chirography, I saw
what had been my body now occupied by
another."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CHAPTER OF PROFIT AND LOSS.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">So</span> overcome was the occupant of the Aunt
Sallie at this point of his story, that he requested
Hopkins' permission to leave his quarters that
he might sit on the floor near the slivers of the
shattered whiskey bottle. He needed stimulant.
Hopkins readily granted the request, for he felt
as if he would not mind having a little stimulant
for himself, but as the last drop available for
his purposes had been put to the use for which
it was intended, he had to deny himself the
comfort he would have derived from it. The
fact that this horrid event, the harrowing details
of which he had just listened to, had occurred
right there in his own apartments served to
make him doubly depressed, for it certainly
indicated that the room, despite its cheerful
situation, had been the dwelling-place of a
supernatural being, and the present lessee was
fearful lest that being should appear on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
scene once more to practise some of his infernal
tricks upon him.</div>

<p>"You mean to say that when you recovered
your senses, you had been deprived of your
body?" said Hopkins at last, breaking the
silence more for the sake of calming his
agitated mind than because he had anything
to say.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the spirit. "I lay there on
the sofa an intellectual abstract whose concrete
had been amputated and invested by a being
who had already lived four-score of years in
one body, and who, having worn that out, was
now on the look-out for a second. The sensation
was dreadful, and when I attempted to do
what theretofore I had always done in moments
of extreme agitation&mdash;to pull fiercely at my
moustache&mdash;I was simply appalled to realize
that the power to raise my hand to do this had
passed, along with the moustache itself, into
the control of that other being. Then an
access of rage surged over me, and I attempted
to stamp my foot and shriek. The shriek was
a success, but my foot like my arm was beyond
my control.</p>

<p>"As the shriek died away I observed my
head slowly turning from the paper before it
on the table, my right hand relaxed its grasp on
the pen, and my own eyes were turned upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
me, and I was simply maddened to see the left
eye wink mischievously at me, while my mouth
broadened into a smile at my own misfortunes.</p>

<p>"'Hello,' I said to myself&mdash;that is you know
the other being in myself said this to me outside
of myself. 'You've come to, at last, eh? I
thought you were going to remain in a comatose
state for ever.'</p>

<p>"'See here, my friend,' I said, trying to be
calm. 'This is a very clever trick you've put
upon me, but from my point of view it is most
uncomfortable, and I'd just as lief have you
evacuate the premises, and permit me once more
to assume my normal condition.'</p>

<p>"'Not until I have accomplished what I set
out to accomplish,' was the answer that fell from
my own lips, which again indulged in an impertinent
smile at my expense. 'You don't suppose
that I have put in three weeks of time and
energy to make you famous with the intention
of withdrawing on the eve of success, do you?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know what you mean,' I replied,
'I don't understand the allusion, nor can I see
why you permit me to be insulted by my own
lips.'</p>

<p>"Here," said the spirit, "my face became
clouded and my smile vanished.</p>

<p>"'Ungrateful wretch that you are!' said he
who had rifled me of myself. 'Are you not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
aware that three weeks have elapsed since you
and your body parted company? Are you not
aware that in that time I have forced the fight
between the brothers Baskins to a point that
has made that case the talk of London, and
you, the hero of the hour in legal circles? Do
you not understand that to-morrow you are to
appear in court to sum up for your side, and
that the London <i>Times</i> itself is to have five
stenographers in court to take down every
word that is uttered by him they call a second
Burke, because of his eloquence, by him they call
a second Sheridan, because of his wit, by him
they call the newly discovered leader of the
English bar, because of the aggressive and
powerful manner in which this now celebrated
will case has been conducted? And finally, are
you not aware that it is you who gain the
credit due to me, since it is I who have merged
my personality into yours, while you have only
to remain quiescent and accord to me the undisturbed
occupation of your physical self for a
few days more?'</p>

<p>"'I know none of these things,' I answered.
'I know that possibly an hour ago you robbed
me of my senses by your infernal machinations,
and that when they are restored to
me I find myself disembodied, nameless,
invisible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>'</p>

<p>"'Do you know the date upon which I visited
you first?' asked my tormentor.</p>

<p>"'Yes, it was November eighth. You
returned on the night of November ninth&mdash;that
is you returned early this evening.'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps this will convince you of the lapse
of time, then,' retorted the occupant of my chair,
tossing me a copy of the <i>Times</i>, 'and these will
prove the rest,' he added, throwing several
other newspapers at the place where my feet
would have been had he not deprived me of
them.</p>

<p>"I looked the papers over. The <i>Times</i> was
dated November twenty-ninth and contained,
as did also the others, a long account of the
trial of the case of Baskins <i>v.</i> Baskins, in
which I seemed to have figured prominently,
concluding with a biographical sketch of myself
coupled with the announcement that my former
neighbours at Buxton were thinking of calling
upon me to stand for Parliament. The tenour
of everything in the papers was complimentary
in the highest degree. It seemed that I had
fairly routed my client's adversaries by nothing
else than the aggressive manner of my fighting;
that the case was practically won, though it
still remained for me to sum up on the morrow,
and that all London was expected to swarm
into the court room to listen to my marvellous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
eloquence. I read and was stunned. My
position was more unhappy than ever, for here
was a greatness builded up for me, that was
utterly beyond my ability once returned to my
corse of clay to sustain, and before me was
placed the horrible alternative of perpetual
exile or stultification."</p>

<p>"Lovely prospect," murmured Hopkins.</p>

<p>"As I read on," continued the spirit, "I
felt the burning gaze of my visitor upon me,
though he could not see me. In my body or
out of it, he still possessed that fearful power
of mental concentration which when exerted
upon another through the medium of the eye
was withering to the soul. So nervous did I
become, that noiseless as a sun-mote I moved
across to the other side of the room, and yet
his gaze followed me as if instinctively aware
of my slightest move. For a time not a word
was spoken by either of us. I was so overcome
at the sudden revelation of my fame, that I
knew not what to say. The words of blame
that entered into my consciousness&mdash;for that
was all that was left of me&mdash;to say, I could not
utter, because however badly I had been treated
by this fearful creature in the beginning, it
could not be denied that he had exerted his
powers entirely for my benefit. On the other
hand, I found it impossible to thank him for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
what he had done, since I was unable to dismiss
the sense of indignation I felt at the summary
and tricky manner in which he had robbed me
of my individuality. As for the other, he
seemed to be thinking deeply, which contributed
to my alarm, for I knew not what it was he
was revolving in his mind, and I feared some
additional exercise of his supernatural power
to my further discomfiture. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>"'I am very deeply disappointed in you,' he
said. 'I at least supposed you to be a person
of gratitude. I deemed your nature to be
sufficiently refined and sensible to favours to
evince some little appreciation of what has been
done for you, but I must say that the veriest
clod of a peasant would be hardly less stolid
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'n'">in</ins> the face of generous effort in his behalf
than you have been toward me. A more
unresponsive soul than yours can hardly have
lived.'</p>

<p>"'Can you blame me for not being effusively
grateful to you for having cut me out of three
weeks of existence?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I can and I do,' he replied. 'You have
not been incommoded. Upon your own confession
you have not even been conscious
during the period that you lacked anatomy.
On the other hand, consider what I have gone
through! I have suffered more in the past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fortnight than I did in my whole previous life.
In making the substitution of my inner self for
yours in your body, I failed to remember how
much greater than the mortal mind is the
mind which has put on omniscience, and I
have found the head in which your intellect
lived at ease, so contracted, so narrow for the
accommodation of mine, that the work I have
undertaken in your interest has been one prolonged
bit of unremitting agony. If you have
ever tried to wear a shoe fifteen sizes too small
for you, you will have a faint glimmering of the
pain I have suffered in trying to encase a
number thirty mind in a seven and a quarter
head. It has been almost impossible for me
to get some of my great thoughts into this
thick cranium of yours in their entirety,&mdash;indeed
if thoughts were visible, your client
might have seen them sticking out of these
ears, or hovering above this lovely halo of
auburn hair you wear, waiting for admission to
an already overcrowded skull.'</p>

<p>"As he spoke these words," said the spirit,
with a chuckle, "I would have given ten
pounds to have had something to smile with.
I never thought one could miss his lips so
much as when I tried to grin and found I had
not the wherewithal. Despite the insulting
comment of my visitor upon the quality of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
own mind, it really filled what there was left
of me with pleasure to hear that, even though I
had departed from it, my body through its
limitations had been able to resent the intrusion
of this alien spirit so effectually.</p>

<p>"'In addition to the bad fit mentally,' continued
the usurper of my anatomy, 'I have had
to cope with your dyspepsia, which I did not
know you had, and various other physical
troubles such as rheumatism and toothache.
It appears to me that even if I had not made
you famous, the mere fact that I have relieved
you of your toothache and rheumatism for
three weeks should entitle me to your gratitude.
However, I am willing to withdraw in
your favour immediately if you insist. Of
course you will have to sum up that case to-morrow,
and I sincerely hope that you will do it
in a manner creditable to your new self, that is
to yourself as I have made you.'</p>

<p>"Of course you see, Hopkins," said the spirit,
pausing in his story for a moment, "what a
dreadful position that left me in. I was
absolutely in the dark as to what had been
done in the case. I did not know what line of
argument had been pursued&mdash;I was even unacquainted
with the name of the presiding
justice at the trial, and as for the testimony
elicited during the three weeks of my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
personal desuetude, I had not read one word of
it. To attempt to sum up the case under the
circumstances meant ruin&mdash;it meant the final
sacrifice of all my hopes; disgrace was
imminent.</p>

<p>"'I cannot sum up the case,' I answered in
a moment. 'I have not mastered the details,
nor is there time for me to do so before the
court opens.'</p>

<p>"'I am aware of that fact,' retorted the
other. 'But that is nothing to me. I am not
at all interested in upholding the undeserved
fame of an ingrate. It's nothing to me if
disgrace stares you in the face. My name is
safe; graven upon a white marble stone in a
country cemetery, it is beyond the reach of
dishonour, and is endorsed in deep-cut letters
with an epitaph extolling the virtues of him
who bore it. This is your affair entirely; I
wash my hands of it. Come, prepare for your
return.'</p>

<p>"Now I submit to you, Hopkins, that, considering
the situation, I was justified in
changing my tone toward him. Put yourself
in my place for a moment," said the spirit.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not," returned Hopkins with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean for you to exchange
places with me. I just want you to try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
imagine what you would have done under the
circumstances. You would have besought
him even as I did to crown his work with final
success, and not leave matters in so unsatisfactory
a condition; to spare you the dishonour
of a public failure, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, either that or suicide would have been
my course," returned Hopkins. "I think I'd
have fled to some apothecary's and concealed
myself in a chloroform bottle until my consciousness
evaporated if I'd been you. You
must have known that this thing could not
keep up for ever, unless you would consent to
remain disembodied all your days."</p>

<p>"That was just the most horrible thing about
it," said the spirit. "When I realized what it
all meant, I was nearly distracted; but believing
suicide to be a crime, and knowing, as I have
already told you, that the mind is indestructible,
I could not do as you suggested. I might have
lulled myself into a state of perpetual unconsciousness,
but I did not care to do that, for the
reason that, despite the harrowing features of
my situation, I was morbidly interested to see
how it would all come out. At any rate, I
succumbed to my fears, and begged him not to
think of departing from my mortal habitation
and leaving me in the lurch.</p>

<p>"'Now,' he replied, his face, or rather my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
face, wreathing with smiles, 'now you are talking
sense. I thought you would come to it.
It would be the height of folly for you to ruin
yourself simply to gratify your love of retaining
your form. I promise you that to-morrow
night, after the great speech has been made in
court&mdash;a speech which will ring out through
the whole country, that will echo from the hills
of Scotland across the Atlantic Ocean to the
Rocky Mountains, to re-echo thence to the
Himalayas, and so on until your fame has encircled
the earth&mdash;I promise you that then I
will depart hence and trouble you no more,
except it be your desire that I return.'"</p>

<p>"That was a fair proposition&mdash;he wasn't such
a mean fiend after all," said Hopkins.</p>

<p>"At that moment I thought he was rather a
square fiend," returned the spirit sadly; "but
he developed as time went on."</p>

<p>"And the speech next day? How was that?
Did he keep his word?" Hopkins asked.</p>

<p>"Indeed he did," said the spirit with enthusiasm,
"and it was simply marvellous. That
night, after we had had the conversation I have
just told you of, that fellow worked like a slave
getting up his points, consulting the records,
classifying the testimony and making notes for
his great oratorical effort. Hardly a poet in
the history of literature was there who did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
contribute some little line or two to make the
speech more interesting, or to emphasize some
point in a manner certain to appeal to a polished
mind or overawe an uncultivated one. Greek
and Latin authors were levied upon for tribute.
Parallels in ancient and modern history utterly
unknown to me were instituted for the elucidation
of the arguments advanced&mdash;in short, a
more polished bit of oratory than that prepared
for my tongue to utter never fell from mortal
lips before, and as for the peroration&mdash;well, it
would require the consummate art of the fiend
himself adequately to describe it. It was
simply dazzling.</p>

<p>"'There is only one drawback, one thing I
fear for to-morrow,' said the fiend, as he
finished his preparations, 'and that is that
these miserable mortal lungs of yours will not
be able to do justice to that speech, and some
of these quotations rasp on your unpractised
tongue, so that I fear their effect may be
weakened. However, I'll do the best I can
with poor tools; but one thing is certain, you
must make a sacrifice to me who have sacrificed
time and comfort to you.'</p>

<p>"'What is that?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I cannot properly accent my words with
your teeth in their present condition. For instance
these words here: <i>And, gentlemen of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
jury, what have we to say of the plaintiff in this
action, the brother of the defendant and the firstborn
son of the decedent whose desires he now
seeks to have over-ridden by the laws of this land,
what have we to say of him? What palliation
can he offer for his unfraternal conduct in thus
dragging his own brother into the courts of this
land in a mad effort to recover the paltry sum
of thirty thousand pounds? History affords no
parallel, gentlemen of the jury, to this cause of son
living arrayed against his parent gone before, of
brother fighting brother for a miserable pittance</i>,
and so on. Don't you see that to be spoken
impressively these words demand a certain
venomous hiss? I want to electrify the jury
by that hiss, but I can't do it unless I have out
two of your back teeth and this front one.'</p>

<p>"Here he tapped the left of my two front
teeth&mdash;pearls they were, Hopkins, pearls beyond
price. Of course I objected.</p>

<p>"'I can't let you do that,' I said, 'it'll ruin
my personal appearance.'</p>

<p>"'Bah, man!' he said. 'What is personal
appearance to pre-eminent success? What are
looks compared to immortality? I must again
take advantage of your helplessness and rescue
you from the effects of your own indecision. I
have arranged to have a dentist here to-morrow
morning at eight. In five minutes he will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the teeth out, and by noon your seething voice
will have turned twelve good men and true
into a mass of goose flesh that will be utterly
unable to resist you.'"</p>

<p>Hopkins was heartless enough to laugh at
this unexpected development.</p>

<p>"I wish I could appreciate the joke, Hopkins,"
said the spirit indignantly. "What is
fun for you was tragedy for me. I had always
prided myself on the vigour of my voice. There
was nothing weak or affected about it, nor
would I, had I been in control of my being,
have permitted such vandalism as was perpetrated
by that dentist the next morning, just
for the sake of making a <i>coup</i> with the jury. I
can't deny, however, that when the speech was
delivered the general effect was heightened by
the sibilant tone in which the words were
spoken. To me the dreadful spirit within my
body was apparent from introduction to peroration.
The deadly greenness of the fiend
shone out through every vein in my body. My
eyes, once a beautiful blue, became like the
eyes of an adder, and my cheeks took on a
pallor that was horrible to look upon, and yet
which so fascinated all beholders that they
could not take their eyes away from it. The
jurors sat petrified, terror depicted on every
line of their faces; the judge himself, a florid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
phlegmatic person ordinarily, was pale as a
sheet and uneasy as an exposed nerve, and when
my poor innocent finger, once so prettily pink
of hue, was pointed, absolutely livid with the
scorn that that creature alone could throw into
it, at the terror-stricken plaintiff, he actually
fell backward into convulsions, and was carried
shrieking profanely from the court-room.</p>

<p>"As for me, I sat cowering directly behind
the jury-box fearful for the future, fearful for
the effect upon my poor body of the terrible
strain that was put upon it, and wondering what
I could possibly do upon resuming my normal
condition to maintain the reputation which
that morning's achievement had brought to
me. So absorbed was I in these reflections
that the judge's faltering charge at the conclusion
of the proceedings fell upon my consciousness
unheard, save as the monotonous
roar of the vehicles in the street outside was
heard; but the verdict of the jury, rendered
without leaving the box, in favour of my client
did reach my ears, and almost simultaneously
came the announcement that there would be no
appeal, since the plaintiff in the cause had been
frightened into imbecility by the fearful indictment
of his character in the summing-up of the
counsel for the defendant."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MAKING OF A NAME.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">You</span> must have felt like a vest-pocket Byron,
to wake up and find yourself famous that way,"
said Toppleton; "or, perhaps you found yourself
<i>in</i>famous, eh? I don't know how it is here
in England, but in America a lawyer who'd
browbeat a poor innocent litigant into a state
bordering upon lunacy, would be requested to
move out of town."</div>

<p>"It all depends," returned the spirit. "If
my substituted self had limited his brow-beating
to the plaintiff, it might have made the reputation
which I found awaiting me upon my return
to my remains, one of infamy, but that was by
no means the case. The judge himself succumbed
to nervous prostration a week later,
the jurors vanished like a pack of frightened
hares immediately they were discharged, and
even my client shook like a leaf when he felt my
eyes resting upon him. As for my own proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
self, I was the worst scared man of the lot; so,
you see, it was a sort of universal awe that was
inspired by the demeanour of my body that day,
and one which commanded rather than invited
respect."</p>

<p>"Did you find your head a little stretched
when you got back into yourself again, or did
he break his word and refuse to let you back?"
queried Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Oh, he kept his word that time," replied
the spirit. "After the trial was over he took a
cab and drove rapidly out to Regent's Park and
back, returning to my chambers about six
o'clock. I was there waiting for him, ready to
enter upon my usual anatomical ways once
more. My client was also there, though, of
course, unaware that I was present in spirit.
I was very much amused to see how utterly
unnerved poor Baskins was by the strange
events of the day. Several times he muttered
to himself remarks like, '<i>I didn't know he had
it in him</i>,' and '<i>If I'd thought he was that kind
of a man I'd have kept blessed clear of him. I
wonder what he'll charge.</i>' And then every time
there was a step or noise of any kind out in the
corridor, he would straighten up nervously and
stare at the door in a tense sort of fashion
which showed that he dreaded meeting me.
Once he put his hand in his pocket and pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
out a big duelling pistol which I was alarmed
to note was loaded to the muzzle. It was
evident that the awe which my new self had
inspired in him amounted to positive fear.</p>

<p>"That duelling pistol put an end to my enjoyment
of the situation," continued the spirit.
"I was afraid he might be goaded into discharging
a load of cold lead into my body. Of
course, I didn't care to have that happen, and
under the agitation of the moment I uttered an
ejaculation of consternation. I never saw in all
my experience a man so thoroughly frightened
as Baskins was when the sound for which he
could not account greeted his ear. He went on
his knees and shook like a leaf, clasping his
hands, as if in prayer, before his face, which
turned a blue white. The pistol fell from his
hands to the floor, and, as it did so, the door
opened, and I saw myself standing on the sill,
haggard of face, but not worn of spirit, for the
supernatural brilliance of my eye as it caught
sight of the pistol and realized at a flash just
what the situation was, showed that the soul
within was still unwearied by its effort.</p>

<p>"Then," added the spirit, his voice husky
with the remembrance of his dishonour,
"came an interview that makes me blush,
even though I have no cheek on which to
display that manifestation of shame. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
body sprang forward as the pistol met my eye,
and, snatching the weapon from the floor, flung
it out through the window into the court, where
it exploded, the jar of contact with the stone
walk being sufficient to discharge it. As the
sharp report of the pistol echoed through the
court my client threw himself flat on his face,
and prostrate there at my feet began to utter a
string of incoherent lamentations and despairing
requests for mercy at my hands which
were painful to hear, and I judged from what
meaning I could patch together from his
jumble of words, that he deemed me an emissary
of Satan,&mdash;and I think he was right.</p>

<p>"'What does this mean?' queried the
fiend within me. 'Murder or suicide? If
you contemplated suicide, I forgive you; if
murder&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I was afraid,' gasped my unhappy client.
'Your power was so terrible; the effect of
your words so awful, that I&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' interrupted the fiend. 'I see. It
was murder you were prepared to do in case
we should not agree, and the power of my eye
should chance to be exerted to win you from
your determination whatever it may have been.'</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;not that&mdash;not that!' shrieked my
client. 'It was but the natural instinct of self-preservation
that led me to&mdash;'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You weaken your cause by your loquacity,
my friend,' said the fiend. 'You suspected
me of contemplating some dishonourable or
cowardly act, and for that reason you entered
the office of him who has saved your good
name and your purse alike from them who
would have robbed you of both, having so little
sense of gratitude that you bring with you an instrument
of death. Very well, let it be so. I
am satisfied if you are. I might do that to
you now which would place you in far worse
estate than your poor brother is in. If you had
your pistol in your hand, aimed at my heart,
you would still be powerless to do me an injury,
for with one glance of my eye I could force
you to turn the muzzle to your own head, and
with another compel you to empty its leaden
load into your own brains. Your suspicions
are insulting, but an insult from one of your
calibre to one of mine is as the sting of a fly to
the elephant; I pass it over and charge it on
the bill. Ten thousand pounds for trying the
case, two thousand five hundred for accepting
your insult, two thousand five hundred for
condoning it, and in one hour must this
money be in my hands with a letter&mdash;a letter
written and signed by you, expressing your
satisfaction with the manner of my conducting
the case, and concluding with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
allusion to your surprise that my charge is
so moderate."</p>

<p>"'And if I refuse to submit to this outrage?'
queried my client, lashed into a show of
courage which he really did not feel.</p>

<p>"'You leave this room a raving maniac, for I
have the power to make you so,' I was appalled
to hear myself reply."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me," said
Hopkins, his bosom heaving with indignation,
"that you sat there like a zero on a pedestal,
and kept silent with this blackmailing infamy
going on under your very eyes?"</p>

<p>"I was speechless with rage," returned the
spirit, "or I should have interfered. Before I
could recover my composure the letter had
been written and the money paid, for my client
still had the sixty thousand pounds in their
original form, in the one thousand pound banknotes.
The struggle he went through was
terrible to witness, and as the notes passed
from his hands into mine he sighed like one
who was heart-broken. The fiend dictated
the letter commending my efforts, and expressing
surprise that the amount asked for my
services was so moderate, and then he opened
the door and ushered the unfortunate victim
out. As the latter left the room the fiend
whispered to him in withering tones to beware<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of his vengeance if he ever attempted to reveal
what had passed since he entered the room.</p>

<p>"'For,' said he, 'if you are not careful, it
matters not in what part of this or any other
world you may be, you must forever be within
my reach, and forever subject to the consequences
of my resentment.'</p>

<p>"Then," said the spirit, "he slammed the
door violently and turned and fixed my eyes
upon the corner wherein I sat aghast with the
mortification of having my name identified in
any man's mind with such a diabolical act as
that I had just witnessed.</p>

<p>"'Now,' he said, 'you may have this carcass
of yours back and welcome. It's lucky for you
I have the power I have. If I hadn't, your body
would be riddled with bullets within twenty-four
hours.'</p>

<p>"'Bah!' I replied. 'That man had no more
intention of using that pistol without provocation
than I have, and considering the terror
with which you have managed to inspire everyone
with whom you have come in contact to-day,
I don't wonder he came armed.'</p>

<p>"'I never thought of that,' said my substitute,
'though what you say about everybody's
terror is true; you might apply it even more
broadly than you do, because as I drove down
the Strand just now even the omnibus horses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
shied, and the driver of my cab had all he could
do to keep his ramshackle steed from running
away. But hurry up and get ready to relieve
me of this mortal incubus of yours, and take
your money&mdash;it's a nice little sum, eh?'</p>

<p>"'Magnificent,' I returned. 'And when you
and I have changed places I am going to return
all but five hundred pounds to that poor fellow
you have just robbed in such a conscienceless
fashion.'</p>

<p>"The moment I said this," said the spirit,
"I regretted it, for he grasped the money with
my right hand, and holding it over the fire,
which was blazing merrily in the grate, he said.
'My friend, I exact from you an oath that you
will not return one penny of this sum to Mr.
Baskins. If you refuse, I shall cast every one of
these bank notes into that fire, nor shall I admit
you once more to your form until the very ashes
of those notes have disappeared into the air.'</p>

<p>"Now what could I do under the circumstances,
Toppleton?" asked the spirit earnestly.
"Could I do anything but swear to what he
asked?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Hopkins, "you could. I
don't believe so vile a creature as he could have
distinguished between a bible and a city directory.
I'd have taken the oath on the city
directory."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas!" said the spirit sadly, and with such
evident sincerity that it jostled the Aunt Sallie
from the chair to the floor. "As I said to you
before, I am only an enduring Briton where
you have the inventive genius of the Yankee.
I never thought of the substitution of the directory
for the bible, and the consequent elimination
of moral responsibility from the oath. I
simply swore as he desired me to, and in an
hour I was alone in my office, the occupant of
a frame so exhausted that I could scarcely lift
my head, and in my pockets were those miserable
bank notes, more burning to my conscience
than had they been sovereign for sovereign in
gold coin hot from the mint."</p>

<p>"Of course," suggested Hopkins, "you
devoted them to the cause of charity; subscribed
all but your just due to the House for
Imbeciles, in which that wronged unfortunate
the plaintiff was incarcerated?"</p>

<p>"I intended something of the sort," returned
the spirit, extricating himself from the head of
Aunt Sallie, and ensconcing himself on the
paper-weight on Hopkins' desk. "But I didn't
have time. You see, immediately after the trial
a perfect avalanche of litigants from other offices
slid into mine, and within a week I was so overwhelmed
with business that I had to hire the
rest of this floor here to find room for my papers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
It was painful to me, too, to observe that those
who had heard of my fame, but who had never
seen me, were manifestly disappointed, when
taking their departure at the close of a first
interview, at having found me so much less
great than they had been led to believe by the
public estimate of my abilities. Nevertheless,
cases of the most intricate sort were fairly
dumped into my hands by the cart-load, and,
worst of all, I found that eminence brought
with it other responsibilities which I was ill-prepared
to meet. I was constantly in receipt
of requests to lecture on subjects of a variety
that would have appalled the fiend himself, and
worse than all I was called into consultation by
the Crown in certain litigation of international
importance. For a time I tried to go it alone,
and by assiduous devotion to study to fit myself
for the responsibilities which my fame had
brought me, but it was impossible. I broke
down in less than a month; but having tasted
the joys of prominence I was not strong enough
to resist the temptation to prolong it indefinitely,
and, without thinking of the means, I committed
myself to certain undertakings which were
utterly beyond my intellectual strength to
accomplish, and then, when brought face to
face with failure and disgrace, there was but
one thing left for me to do, and that I did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I summoned the fiend. The mere expression
of a desire to see him was sufficient to
bring him into my presence, and time and time
again did I subject my poor body for ambition's
sake to the dreadful interchange of spirits.</p>

<p>"From without I watched my development
from mediocrity to fame with a joyous interest,
not unmixed, however, with regret, for, at such
moments as were permitted me to enjoy the
undivided possession of myself, I could not but
feel conscious of a diminution of physical
strength which detracted materially from my
happiness; and yet when day after day I saw
my name in print, and noted that I was
regarded as one of the most marvellous intellectual
products of the day, I could not bring
myself to the point where I could renounce
everything I had gained, and withdraw to the
contented life of the recluse. Let a man once
taste a living immortality, Hopkins, and I care
not how strong his character may be, he would
part with all that he holds most dear sooner
than he would renounce that.</p>

<p>"And so it went on for a full year. I
became the leading light of the English bar;
I astonished the world as a public orator; so
potent were my arguments that in court or on
the hustings none were able to resist me. At
public dinners I was the speaker who alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
could hold the feasters when the seductions of
the wine cup awaited the cessation of my eloquence.
Had I been able to extend the hours
of my days from twenty-four to ten times
twenty-four, I could not have responded to all
the calls that were made upon my time. Then
as if to show the world that one profession was
too small to hold the boundless qualities of
my genius, I startled the English reading
public with a novel, the depth and power
of which stirred the soul of the most <i>blas&eacute;</i> of
novel-readers, and the presses of my publisher
were taxed to the utmost to supply the demand
for my work; then came a volume of poems
which caused my name to be mentioned as a
possible successor to the laureateship; then a
series of essays on scientific and philosophical
subjects which were nearly my undoing, since
my omniscient self, as I came to call the fiend
who was responsible for my greatness, was
absent upon one occasion when I was called
upon unexpectedly to receive a delegation of
Scottish scientists, who had travelled from
Edinburgh to London to consult with me in
regard to certain propositions advanced in my
book. What they thought of me Heaven only
knows. You see, Hopkins, as far as my
original self was concerned there wasn't an
atom of scientific knowledge in my body, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to tell you the truth I hadn't even read my
book, concerning which these unwelcome grey
beards had come from Edinburgh to speak."</p>

<p>"I should like to have been on hand to hear
you," said Hopkins with a laugh. "You must
have felt like Damocles!"</p>

<p>"I was worse off than Damocles. He was
face to face with nothing but death. I was
having a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with dishonour. Damocles
had a sword suspended over his head, held in
place by a hair, I had a Krupp cannon over
mine, held in place by Heaven knows what."</p>

<p>"How did you get out of it?" queried
Hopkins. "Summon the fiend?"</p>

<p>"What, summon that deadly green thing
before those men, and change places with him
in the presence of witnesses? I fancy not. I
have been a complete hall-marked fool in many
respects, Hopkins, but my idiocy never went
as far as that. The only thing left for me to
do was to acquiesce in nine things that those
fellows said, and look doubtful at the tenth and
say I didn't know about that; my inherent
love of compromise and my ingenuity in that
direction stood me in good stead upon that
occasion. It was a narrow squeak, but I got
through all right. The <i>savants</i> went back to
Edinburgh somewhat disappointed, I presume,
with the new sun on the scientific horizon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
And you ought to have seen how the fiend
laughed when I told him about it the next time
I saw him! He fixed it all right, however, by
sitting down and writing a letter to my late
visitors and answering every one of their questions,
and asking them a few additional ones,
to answer which I fancy put them to their
trumps.</p>

<p>"After making me famous as scientist,
novelist and lawyer, the fiend induced a
political bee to enter my cap, and one day
after an absence of a week from my body,
during which period of time I was utterly in
the dark as to its whereabouts, I was appalled
to see it reel in at the door in a maudlin state
that revolted me.</p>

<p>"'Well,' I said as soon as I was able to
speak,' what new disgrace is this you have put
upon me? Am I to make my mark now as an
inebriate, or is this simply a little practical
joke you are putting upon my sensibilities?
If it is the latter, it is a mighty poor joke.'</p>

<p>"'No,' returned the fiend, who I am pleased
to say showed some sense of shame at the
plight he had got me into this time. 'No, this
is not a practical joke, nor do I wish to ruin
your reputation for sobriety. I regret this apparent
liquidation of your system quite as much
as you do, not because I care what others say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
though. It is because I find it much harder to
manage your body under these present circumstances.
When one leg wants to go dancing
down Pall Mall, and the other evinces a strange
desire to walk gravely off in the direction of
Scotland Yard, it is a most difficult thing for a
mind not thoroughly in sympathy with either
of them to drive them down the Strand in
that modest, unassuming fashion which alone
enables one to avoid police supervision. I've
had the devil's own time with this weak corse
of yours, and if I had known how abominably
light-headed and airy-legged a little strong
drink made you, I never should have had you
stand for Parliament&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Stand for Parliament?' I cried, aghast at
the new honour which was being thrust upon
me. 'Have I been standing for Parliament?'</p>

<p>"'Well, not exactly' laughed the fiend.
'You've been sort of held up for Parliament;
you haven't been able to stand up without wobbling
for five days; in fact, not since you tried
to do your duty by your constituency, and take
a little something at your own expense with a
few rounds of doubtful voters. You were
nearly defeated, my boy, because of your disgusting
inability to cope with the flowing bowl,
but I managed to pull you through. The
temperance people voted to a man against you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
but the other interests stood by you pretty well,
and you now represent your old neighbours
in&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'My old neighbours,' I moaned. 'Have I
been made to appear to my old neighbours in
the light of a dissipated politician when all my
life long I had been known to them as a
sober&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Don't dwell on that point, my good fellow,'
interrupted the fiend. 'Forget it. In
forgetfulness of what you have been, and in consideration
of what you have become, lies happiness.
By the way&mdash;have you a mother living?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I answered, numb with anxiety for
fear of what was coming. 'You haven't disgraced
me in her eyes, have you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no,' returned the fiend. 'But a lady
claiming to be your mother visited me during
the campaign, and was very indignant because
I failed to recognize her&mdash;that cost you some
votes, but not enough to change the result.
She didn't look a bit like you, and I was afraid
the opposition was putting up some game on
us, so I just laughed her off.'</p>

<p>"'You&mdash;you laughed her off&mdash;you mean to
tell me,' I stammered, 'that when my mother
came to my political headquarters to see her
son, he refused to recognize her, and laughed
her off?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, come,' said the fiend indignantly,
'don't get angry. Remember one thing, please.
You are now a member of Parliament, a great
Lawyer, a famous Scientist, a Novelist and an
Orator. It is I who have made you so. If
you don't like what I've done, we'll call the
arrangement off, and you can make a spectacle
of yourself in the eyes of the world. I hate an
ingrate. You couldn't expect me to know a
lady whom I never even saw before, and when
I have a big scheme on foot I do not intend to
have it spoiled for want of caution. If I made
you seem an undutiful son, I am sorry for it,
and will strive to make amends next time I
meet your mother. I'll write a formal apology
if you desire, but I don't wish to hear any more
of your sentimental nonsense. Much has to
be sacrificed in achieving greatness, and you
have got therewith just about as little personal
inconvenience as any man in history. Stop
your snivelling, or I'll desert your cause, and
what that means even you can grasp.'</p>

<p>"With these words," concluded the spirit,
"he departed, and left me to sleep off the effects
of a seven days' campaign in which my moral
welfare had been sacrificed to the thirst of at
least four hundred doubtful voters. Credited
with a seat in Parliament, I found my name
debited with the crime of intemperance, lack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of self-respect, and a gross affront to my own
mother; a fine record for one week in which in
my own consciousness I was unable to recollect
doing anything that could not have been done
with propriety by a candidate for canonization."</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated Toppleton, deeply
moved by the horror of the weary spirit's story.
"It strikes me that canonization in the form in
which it was used on the Sepoys in '57 would
be mild punishment for that Nile-green brute
that got you into this. To tell you the truth,
Sallie, the fearful justice of your cause is almost
enough to make me withdraw entirely. I
should hate to be called upon to prosecute a
defendant of the nature of your verdant
visitor."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CROWNING ACT OF INFAMY.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Hear</span> me to the end, Hopkins, I beseech
you," said the exile earnestly. "Of course
the fiend strikes you as a being to be avoided,
but I do not believe that he is now as powerful
and as terrible as he was in the days gone by.
Long confinement to a purely mortal sphere
must necessarily have weakened his supernatural
powers, and it strikes me that properly
managed by a young and aggressive lawyer, our
case against him would be won in an instant.
At all events, do not compel me to leave my
story unfinished. I am sure that when you
hear of the crowning act of infamy of which my
evil genius was guilty, you will not hesitate a
moment in making up your mind that duty
summons you to aid me."</div>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Hopkins. "Go on
with the tale, only do not be too sanguine as
to its results in convincing me that I am the
man to extricate you from this horrid plight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"After I had attended one or two meetings
of the House of Commons," said the exile,
resuming the thread of his story, "I enjoyed
the experience so much that I almost forgave
the fiend for having so nearly ruined me with
all my old friends; and having written, in
accordance with his promise, a truly beautiful
letter to my mother, explaining away the harsh
treatment she had suffered at the hands of her
now illustrious son on the ground of his not
being quite himself on that occasion&mdash;a state
of mind due to too close attention to work and
study&mdash;I quite forgave him for that unpleasant
episode in my campaign. My mother too overlooked
the affront, and wrote me a most affectionate
epistle, stating that I might trample
upon her most cherished ideals with her entire
acquiescence if my taking that course would
ensure to her the receipt of so loving and
touching a letter as the one I had sent her.
The fiend and I both had to smile, on receiving
my mother's note, to observe that the dear old
lady attributed my ability to express myself in
such beautiful terms to the poetic traits I had
inherited from her.</p>

<p>"'She's very proud of her dear boy,' sneered
the fiend.</p>

<p>"'In spite of his brutality at the committee-room,'
I retorted; and then we both grinned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for each truly believed that he had got the
better of the other."</p>

<p>"It was a pretty close contest," said Hopkins.
"But on the whole the laugh seems to be on
you."</p>

<p>"It certainly was the first time I tried to
speak in Parliament," returned the spirit.
"Such a failure was never seen. I was to take
part in a very important debate, and when the
hour came for me to get on my feet and talk, I
was my weak-kneed self and utterly unacquainted
even with the side I was expected to
take. The fiend had promised to do all the
talking, and on this occasion failed to materialize.
I spoke for ten minutes in an incoherent fashion,
mouthing my words so that no one could understand
a syllable that I uttered. It was a fearful
disappointment to my friends in the House and
in the galleries; the latter being packed when it
was understood that I was to speak. Of course,
when the fiend appeared later on, he straightened
it all out, and the printed speech which
he dictated and which I wrote was really a fine
effort and did our party much good. But these
little embarrassments were tragedies to me, and
at every new success I quailed before the possibilities
of disastrous failure at the next effort.
In but one respect was I entirely free from the
fiendish influence, and that was in the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of my love. From that phase of my life the
fiend kept himself apart, and it was the only
joyous oasis to be found in the boundless desert
of my misery. To the fiend, Sunday was
literally a day of rest, for upon that day he
never approached me, and I devoted it to
calling upon the woman I loved.</p>

<p>"She was a beautiful woman, the only
daughter of a retired city merchant, and fond
of the admiration of successful men. That
she loved me before I attained to eminence in
the various professions in which the fiend had
compelled me to dabble, I had much reason to
believe; but I had never ventured to make
love to her in dead earnest, because I feared
for the result. She had often said to me that
while she should never marry for riches and
position, she did not intend to fall in love with
any man just because he had neither, and that
no man need ever propose marriage to her who
was not reasonably sure of a successful career.
It was not selfishness that led her to think and
speak in this manner, but a realizing sense of
the unhappy fact that mediocrity married is
as hopeless as a broken-winded race-horse in
harness. There is plenty of ambition but
no future, and as she often said, 'Where
hopelessness comes, happiness dwelleth
not!'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"A daughter of Solomon, I wot," interrupted
Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the spirit, with a sigh for her he
had lost, "and rather superior to the old
gentleman in a great many ways. Of course I
understood, and, lacking achievement in my
profession, discreetly held my tongue on the
subject of matrimony, taking good care, however,
when I called never to let any other
fellow outstay me, unless perchance he was
some poor drivelling idiot from whose immediate
present the laurel was further removed than
from my own. She understood me, I think,
though I never put that point to a practical
test by a proposal of marriage. This was the
state of affairs at the time of my first meeting
with the fiend, and for a year subsequent to
that ill-starred night upon which he first crossed
my path I let matters take their own course,
waiting a favourable opportunity to ask the
great question, upon the answer to which hung
all my future happiness. I could see that with
my increasing fame, her interest in me waxed;
but as every passing day brought new and undreamed-of
distinctions she grew more and
more reserved toward me&mdash;a most feminine
trait that, Hopkins. When a woman begins to
love a man in dead earnest, in nine cases out of
ten she will make him feel that he is utterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
abhorrent to her, and it's a good thing she does,
because it makes him look carefully into his
own character in an endeavour to discover and
to root out all the undesirable features thereof.
It is this that enables love to redeem men whom
the world considers irredeemable, so, of course,
I had no feeling of discouragement at her growing
coldness, for, understanding women, I knew
exactly what it meant. I think I was more or
less of an enigma to her."</p>

<p>"I should think it likely," said Toppleton.
"If she really knew you, she must have been
mightily surprised at your sudden strides towards
universal genius. It's a wonder to me
that she did not suspect the enigma, and give it
up."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the spirit. "It was very
embarrassing to me when she expressed her surprise
at my progress, and asked me how I did
it, and other questions equally hard to answer.
And then her father, who was always more or
less insufferable, now became absolutely insulting&mdash;that
is, his new found appreciation of my
virtues led him into making assertions which
galled me, he little knew how much&mdash;assertions
to the effect that to look at me no one would
suspect that I had more than ordinary intelligence;
that to hear me talk one would never
suppose I could make a speech of any kind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
much less set the world on fire by my
eloquence; and finally, that no man after this
could tell him that it was possible to judge of
the future by the past, or the past by the present,
for he had always thought me foredoomed
to failure, and I had achieved success, and,
having achieved success, gave no present
evidence that I deserved it."</p>

<p>"He had the making of the accepted mother-in-law
in him," said Hopkins. "What could
have induced you to fall in love with the
daughter of a man like that?"</p>

<p>"She was a superb woman, that's what,"
rejoined the spirit with enthusiasm, "and when
I think of the happiness that the Nile-green
shade first placed within my reach and then
snatched from me, I regret that the soul is immortal,
and that I am not all-powerful, for it
would please me to grind his soul into absolute
nothingness.</p>

<p>"It was at least a year and two months
subsequent to my first meeting with him," continued
the spirit as soon as his overwrought
feelings would permit, "that he first broached
the subject of matrimony. He had attended a
grand ball at the house of the Earl of Piccadilly
and was the lion of the occasion owing to his
stand in certain recent Parliamentary crises.
His readiness in debate had gained him a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
position, and his natural grace of manner&mdash;that
is, <i>my</i> natural grace of manner&mdash;had helped him
to a hold on the affections of those with whom
he was associated, for, as he grew more accustomed
to my figure and got his angles comfortably
rounded off to fit my curves, he managed
to subdue that horrible aspect he had assumed
with such fearful effect in the trial of Baskins <i>v.</i>
Baskins, and when geniality was the attribute
most likely to help him on he was geniality
personified. The ball was ostensibly one of the
Earl of Piccadilly's usual series of annual functions,
but in reality it was given for the purpose
of introducing me into society. From all
accounts, it was a grand affair, and I seemed
to have made as fine an impression as a social
debutant as I had in the law courts, in the field
of literature, and in the House of Commons.
If the fiend spoke truly that night, when he
returned and handed my fatigued body over to
me for a rest, I made a marked success; all the
ladies were raving about me; I was a divine
dancer, though before that night my feet had
never tripped to the strains of a waltz, polka,
or any other terpsichorean exercise. I pleased
the dowagers as well as the maids, and had, in
short, become an eligible&mdash;that is I had become
as desirable a matrimonial <i>parti</i> as an untitled
person could hope to be, and the fiend remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with a sly wink that it was not beyond the
range of possibilities that the Premier would
bestow upon me one of the peerages at his disposal
when the proper time came.</p>

<p>"'Bachelorhood is pardonable in a young
man,' said my evil genius upon this occasion,
'but we must marry if we are to reach the
pinnacle of success. There is a solidity about
the married man's estate that bachelorhood
lacks, and I rather think I can make a match
that will push us ahead.'</p>

<p>"'I don't think I need your assistance,' I
replied. 'In fact I prefer that some of the
things which pertain to myself shall be left
entirely in my own hands. In matters of the
affections I can take care of myself.'</p>

<p>"'Very well,' was the fiend's response.
'Have your own way about it, only take my
advice and get married. We need a wife.'</p>

<p>"'We?' I cried. 'We! I just want you
to understand, my dear sir, that the pronoun
doesn't fit the case. <i>I</i> may need a wife and <i>you</i>
may need a wife, but if you think I'm going into
any co-operative scheme with you in that matter
you are less omniscient than usual. Remember
that please and let us have nothing more to say
on the subject.'"</p>

<p>"That was a very proper stand for you to
take," said Hopkins, gravely. "Though I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that, under the circumstances, you should have
given up all ideas of marriage. No woman
would have you, knowing that you were not
yourself at times; and then having as little control
over your other self as you seem to have
had, you would often have found yourself
in hot water for flirting with other women,
when, in reality, your own self was as innocent
as a mountain daisy."</p>

<p>"I know I did wrong in thinking of marriage,
Hopkins," returned the spirit, "but if you had
ever met the woman I loved, you would have
loved her too&mdash;yes, even if you were a confirmed
celibate. I don't believe a Cardinal, sir, would
have hesitated between his hat and her. My
sole justification was her loveliness, and then
the fiend's ready acquiescence in my statement
that in that matter he must hold aloof gave me
confidence that I might safely take the step I
had so long and so ardently desired to take.</p>

<p>"Weeks passed by, and in everything save
the courtship of Miss Hicksworthy-Johnstone
I gave myself unreservedly over to the fiend,
who began suddenly to take an interest in my
personal appearance which he had never before
manifested. He laid in a fine supply of
clothes&mdash;dress suits, walking suits, lounging
suits&mdash;suits in fact of every description and of
the finest texture. Shirts and collars, and ties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the choicest sort were imported by him from
Paris, and on my hands I now observed he was
beginning to wear kid gloves of fashionable
type. His hats and shoes were distinctly in
the mode, and his jewelry, as far as it went,
was of unexceptionable taste and quiet elegance.
In fact, Toppleton, I began to be
something of a dandy. This I attributed to
the natural vanity of my other self. I, too, was
proud of that graceful form, but I never
thought enough about it to go about arraying
it in a fashion which neither Solomon nor the
lily of the field could ever have approached. I
cared nothing for gloves save as a means to a
warm finger's end, and it made no difference to
me whether my hat was of the style of '48, or
plucked fresh from the French Emperor's own
block. As long as my head was covered I was
satisfied. Patent leather shoes I could never
bring myself to buy, because they had always
seemed to me to go hand in hand either with
poverty or laziness. To a man who cannot
afford shoe blacking or who is too lazy to
black his own boots, patent leathers, I thought,
were a boon; but I never classed myself under
either head, and wore the regular foot gear of
the plain but honest son of toil.</p>

<p>"But now all was changed. My other self
was vain, and unexpectedly gave himself over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to dandyism. At first he rather disturbed
my equanimity by wearing somewhat loud
patterns, but he soon got over that, and between
us, after a very little while, two or three
months perhaps, my body had the best clothes
there were to be had in all London. I had not
realized all this time that I was fast becoming a
millionaire, and when my tailor's bill for fifteen
hundred pounds came home one night I was in
a great stew, but the fiend came in and relieved
my conscience very much by showing me my
balance in the bank. It amounted, Toppleton,
to one hundred and seventy-five thousand
pounds, with an income still running evenly
along from my law practice of ten thousand
pounds per annum, not to mention the
revenues from my books, which in six months
had amounted to two thousand pounds. I was
a rich man, and when I observed that this was
my condition, I made up my mind to ask Miss
Hicksworthy-Johnstone's hand in marriage the
very next time I saw her. I hoped this would
be soon, but, alas for human expectations, it
was not. The Christmas holidays were about
to begin, and I bethought me that at the
season of goodwill toward men I might ask
the possessor of my heart to accept it as a
permanent gift, a decision which I unfortunately
kept to myself, for from one end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
holidays to the other I never laid eyes upon my
mortal habitation. The fiend was off with it
for one whole month, Hopkins."</p>

<p>"Didn't you know where?" asked Toppleton.</p>

<p>"I did not," returned the spirit. "He
went off with it as usual one night late in
November to attend a meeting of the leaders
of our party, telling me not to worry if he did
not return for twenty-four hours, since there
was important business on hand. What the
business was he did not inform me, nor did I
seek to know it, since under our arrangement
it was not necessary that I should familiarize
myself with parliamentary matters, which were
usually as dry as they were weighty anyhow,
and hence distasteful to me.</p>

<p>"Well, I waited twenty-four hours and no
fiend appeared. Another day passed with no
sign of him. A third day moved into the
calendar of the past; a week elapsed, then a
second, a third, a fourth, and finally a month
had gone. I was growing sick with apprehension.
What if something dreadful had
happened and my lovely, only body was lying
dead somewhere, too shattered for the fiend to
remain longer within it, and gone for ever from
me? What if the present occupant of my
corse had again yielded to the seductive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
influence of the cup, and was off somewhere
upon a prolonged spree? I floated uneasily in
and about my quarters here, sleepless, worried to
distraction. I searched my papers, as best I
could without hands, to see if there was not
some clue as to my whereabouts among them,
and found none. I went through the contents
of the waste basket even, and found nothing to
relieve my dreadful anxiety, and then I went
to the wardrobe to search the pockets of
my clothes for possible evidence to calm my
agitated soul.</p>

<p>"Toppleton, there was not one vestige of a
garment in that clothes press from top to bottom.
Not a shoe, not a coat, absolutely nothing.
It was bare even as Mother Hubbard's cupboard
was bare. This was an additional
shock, and I became giddy with fear. I floated
madly across to the bureau and peered into the
drawers thereof. Beyond the ties I had
formerly worn and the collars, frayed at the
edges, of my neglig&eacute;e days, nothing remained,
and then for the first time I noticed that my
trunk was gone from the room.</p>

<p>"'What can it mean?' I asked myself,
though I might as well have spared the question,
for it was one I could not answer. Days
came and went, leaving me still pondering.
Christmas Eve came and found me here moping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in a cheerless apartment, friendless, forlorn,
clothesless and bodiless&mdash;a fine way to pass
what should have been the happiest night of
the year."</p>

<p>"Elegant!" said Toppleton. "It might
have been worse though. If you had had your
body and still been clothesless you would have
found it rather cold, I fancy."</p>

<p>"I had almost given up all hope of ever
seeing myself again," continued the exile,
ignoring Hopkins' interruption, "when on the
evening of January second I heard a step
coming along the hall which I at once recognized
as my own, my latch-key was inserted in
the lock and the door was opened, and at last I
stood before myself again, the picture of health
and happiness.</p>

<p>"'Are you there?' my lips said with a broad
smile, as my body entered the room.</p>

<p>"'I am,' I replied shortly; 'and I've been
here, Heaven knows how long, worried sick to
know what had become of you. I don't think
you are the most considerate fiend in the world
to take me off for weeks without letting me
know anything of my whereabouts.'</p>

<p>"'I am very sorry,' said the fiend, throwing
himself down on the lounge. 'I meant to have
told you, but you were not here when I returned.
Lord Smitherton invited me out to his house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
at Snorley Farms for the Christmas holidays
along with the Earl of Pupley, General Carlingberry-Jimpson,
and a half-dozen members of
the Birmingham Society of Fine Arts. It was
an invitation I could not well refuse, and,
besides, our carcass here was beginning to feel
the need of an outing, so I accepted. I came
back here to tell you about it, but you must
have been floating about somewhere else. At
all events, you are much better for the outing,
and your purely mortal self has had a good
time. And, by the way, I want to warn you
about one point. When you are the occupant
of this corse, I think you would better not walk
down Rotten Row, or go anywhere in fact
where I am accustomed to going, because you
don't know my friends any more than I know
yours, and that is apt to lead to misunderstanding.
Lady Romaine Cushing, who was
visiting Lady Smitherton, told me that I had
cut her dead in the Row one afternoon, although
she had stopped her carriage particularly to
speak to me. It was you who cut her, but, of
course, you were not to blame, because you
never saw Lady Romaine Cushing; but it is
hard to explain away little matters of that sort,
and I had the deuce of a time getting her to
believe that her eye must have deceived her.
We can't afford to offend our friends of the fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sex, you know; they can make or mar a man
these days.'</p>

<p>"'And I am to be kept away from the haunts
of polite society,' I said, with some natural indignation,
'just because it embarrasses <i>you</i> to
explain why I don't bow to people I don't
know.'</p>

<p>"'But it's all for your good,' he replied.
'You seem to forget that I am actuated entirely
by the best of motives.'</p>

<p>"'No doubt,' I said, 'but I think it's rather
hard on me to be excluded from the most
attractive quarter of London.'</p>

<p>"'You are not excluded. You can walk
there if you choose at night or very early in the
morning, or when Society is out of town, or,
better still, you can float there in your invisible
state at anytime. In fact,' added the fiend, 'it
would be very enjoyable for you, I should think,
to do that last. You can poise yourself over a
tree for instance, and watch yourself hobnobbing
with the illustrious. You can sit in your invisibility
in any one of the carriages that roll
to and fro, and, as long as you do not obtrude
yourself on the occupants, there is not an
equipage in London, high or low, in which you
cannot ride. You are better off than I am in
that respect. While I have no particular shape
I am visible like a bit of sea-fog, but you being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
invisible can go anywhere without making
trouble. The theatres are open to you free of
charge. The best seats are at your disposal.
If you choose to do it you could even sit on the
throne of England, and nobody would be the
wiser.'</p>

<p>"'That's all very well,' I said; 'but I don't
care to travel about in that impersonal fashion.
I prefer the incarnate manner of doing things,
and if you will kindly permit me to assume
bodily form once more, I'll be very much
obliged.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly!' he replied, and with that we
changed places.</p>

<p>"The sensation of getting back to my accustomed
figure once more was delightful, and there
was no denying the fact that I was better off
for the outing I had so unceremoniously taken.
My step was elastic, my head felt clear as a
bell, and, altogether, I had never before enjoyed
the consciousness of so great a physical strength
as now was mine.</p>

<p>"This feeling gave me courage to do many
things which I had hitherto put off, and among
them was the making of a proposal of marriage
to the admired Miss Hicksworthy-Johnstone.
It was seven o'clock when the fiend had left me
to the personal enjoyment of my complete self,
and at eight o'clock I was in a hansom cab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
speeding out to the dwelling-place of the woman
I loved. At eight thirty I was on my knees
before her, and by eleven o'clock I was her
accepted suitor. Such happiness as was mine,
Hopkins, no man ever knew. The only
trouble known to my soul at the moment
was the consciousness that Arabella, as I was
now permitted to call Miss Hicksworthy-Johnstone,
was in the dark as to the methods by
which my greatness had been achieved. I
could not confess my dreadful secret to her, for
that would have put an end entirely to our relations,
and I loved her so that I could not bring
myself to give her up. She asked me numberless
questions of a most embarrassing sort, as
if she suspected there was something wrong,
but I managed in some way, I know not how, to
give a plausible answer to every one of them."</p>

<p>"Possibly the fiend left a little of his brain
in your head when he got out," suggested
Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," returned the exile. "However
it was, I managed to make out a satisfactory
case for myself, and at the close of a cross-examination
such as no man ever went through
before, lasting two and a half hours, Arabella
threw herself into my arms and called me by
my first name. She was mine, and all the
world seemed bright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"I walked home," continued the spirit,
"and in a condition of ecstasy that almost
compensates for all I have suffered since. My
feet seemed hardly to touch the ground, and I
whistled from the time I left Arabella until I
entered my room here,&mdash;a reprehensible habit,
perhaps, but one which had always been my
method of expressing satisfaction with the
world. As I entered this room I was brought
down from my ecstatic heights to an appreciation
of my actual state, for the first thing to
greet my eyes was the fiend, greener than ever,
sitting by the fire ruminating apparently, for it
was at least five minutes before he took note
of my presence, although I addressed him
politely as soon as I saw him.</p>

<p>"'Hallo,' he said finally. 'Where have
you been?'</p>

<p>"The question was as unexpected as it was
natural, and I was unprepared for it, so I made
no reply, covering my silence by taking off my
shoes and preparing for bed.</p>

<p>"'Where have you been?' he asked again,
this time in a tone so peremptory that I
decided in an instant not to tell him.</p>

<p>"'Out,' I answered. 'Where have you?'</p>

<p>"At this he laughed.</p>

<p>"'Don't be impudent,' he said. 'I do not
wish to pry into your affairs. I only wanted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
know where you had been because I am
interested in you, and I want to help you to
avoid pitfalls.'</p>

<p>"'That's all right,' I responded graciously.
'I appreciate your kindness, but you need not
be interested in where I have been to-night,
because I have been engaged in a little matter
that concerns you not at all.'</p>

<p>"'Very well,' he replied, turning once more
to the fire. 'I'll take your word for it; only
you and I must be perfectly candid with each
other, or complications may arise, that's all.
By the way, I'll have to borrow you again to-morrow
morning. There are a half-dozen
members of Parliament coming here to discuss
certain matters of state, and you would be
somewhat embarrassed if you undertook to
meet them.'</p>

<p>"'That suits me,' I said, happy enough to
acquiesce in anything. 'Only I'll want to get
back here to-morrow evening. I have an
engagement.'</p>

<p>"The fiend eyed me narrowly for a moment,
and I winced beneath his gaze.</p>

<p>"'All right,' he said, 'you can get back, but
this Parliamentary business is very important,
and I <i>must</i> have the semblance of a mortal
being every morning this week.'</p>

<p>"'That can be arranged,' I replied. Arabella<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
could have my evenings, and he could
have my mornings. That was fair enough, I
thought, and so it happened. Every night for
a week I spent in the company of my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>,&mdash;whose
name, by the way, I never mentioned in
the fiend's presence&mdash;and every morning for
the same period he was in charge, conducting
negotiations which only served to make me
more famous.</p>

<p>"Finally the dreadful morning came. It
was Saturday, and the fiend and I were sitting
together in my quarters. We had just
changed places. I was in my present disembodied
state, and the fiend had taken possession
for the day, when there was heard in the
corridor a quick nervous step which stopped as
he who directed it came to my door, and a
voice, which to my consternation I recognized
at once as that of Arabella's father following
close upon a resounding knock, cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'This is the place. This is the kennel in
which the hound lives. Open the door!'</p>

<p>"There was not time for the fiend and me to
change places. Indeed, I had hardly recognized
the old gentleman's voice, when the fiend
in answer to his demand opened the door.</p>

<p>"A madder man than my prospective
father-in-law appeared to be I never saw,
Hopkins," said the spirit, his voice trembling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with emotion. "He was livid, and when the
door opened, and he saw the man he supposed
to be me standing before him showing absolutely
no signs of recognition, he fairly foamed
at the mouth.</p>

<p>"'How do you do, sir?' said the fiend, polite
as Chesterfield.</p>

<p>"'Don't speak to me, you puppy,' roared the
old gentleman. 'Don't you dare to address
me until I address you.'</p>

<p>"'This is most extraordinary,' said the fiend,
seemingly nonplussed at Mr. Hicksworthy-Johnstone's
inexplicable wrath; for he could
understand it no better than I, and to me it
was absolutely incomprehensible, for I was not
aware of anything that I had done that could
possibly give rise to so violent an ebullition of
rage. 'I am at a loss, sir, to understand why
you enter the office of a gentleman in a fashion
so unbecoming to one of your years; you must
have made some mistake.'</p>

<p>"'Mistake!' shrieked Arabella's father.
'Mistake, you snivelling hypocrite? What
mistake can there be? Do you see that note
in this week's <i>Vanity Fair</i>, you vile deceiver?
Do you see me? Do you see anything?'</p>

<p>"'I see you,' replied the fiend calmly, 'and
I wish I didn't.'</p>

<p>"'I'll go bond you wish you didn't,' howled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the enraged visitor. 'And when I get through
with you you'll wish I hadn't brought this oak
stick along with me. Now I want to know
what explanation you have to make of that
paragraph in the paper.'</p>

<p>"'I cannot explain what I have not read,'
returned the fiend. 'Nor shall I attempt to
read what you wish to have explained until I
know who you are, and what possible right you
can have to demand an explanation of anything
from me. What are you, anyhow, a retired
maniac or simply an active imbecile?'</p>

<p>"As the fiend spoke these words," said the
spirit, "I tried to arrest him; but he was so
angry that he either could not or would not
hear my whispered injunction that he be silent.
As for the old gentleman, he sat gasping in his
chair, glaring at my poor self, a perfect picture
of apoplectic delirium. The fiend returned the
glare unflinchingly.</p>

<p>"'Well!' gasped Mr. Hicksworthy-Johnstone
after a minute's steady glance, 'if you
aren't the coolest hand in Christendom. Who
am I, eh? What am I here for, eh? What's
my name, eh? What claim have I on you,
eh? Young man, you are the most consummate
Lothario on the footstool. You are a Don
Juan with the hide of a rhinoceros and the
calmness of a snow-clad Alp, but I can just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
tell you one thing. You can't trifle with
Arabella!'</p>

<p>"And then, Hopkins, that infernal fiend
looked my father-in law elect square in the eye
and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Who the devil is Arabella?'</p>

<p>"As the words fell from my lips, the old
gentleman with an oath started from his chair,
and grasping the inkstand from the table, hurled
it with all his force at my waistcoat, which
received it with breathless surprise; and then,
Toppleton, it breaks my heart to say it, but my
foot&mdash;the foot of him who loved Arabella to
distraction,&mdash;was lifted against her father, and
the man to whom he had promised his daughter's
hand, appeared to kick him forcibly, despite his
grey hairs, out into and along the corridor to
the head of the stairs. Then, as I watched,
the two men grappled and went crashing down
the stairs, head over heels together.</p>

<p>"Sick with fear and mortification, I flew
back into the room, where, lying upon the floor,
I saw the copy of <i>Vanity Fair</i> that Mr. Hicksworthy-Johnstone
had brought, and marked
with blue pencil upon the page before me was
printed the announcement of the engagement
of myself to Ariadne Maude, second daughter
of John Edward Fackleton, Earl of Pupley, of
Castle Marrowfat, Sauceton Downs, Worcestershire."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SPIRIT'S STORY IS CONCLUDED.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">I should</span> say," volunteered Hopkins, with a
shake of his head, "that that was about the
most unpleasant situation he had got you into
yet; and yet he was not entirely to blame. He
requested candour from you, and you declined
to be candid. You should have told him of
your engagement to Miss Hicksworthy-Johnstone.
That would at least have prevented his
kicking her father out of your office and rolling
downstairs with him."</div>

<p>"It is easy enough to say now what ought
to have been done," sobbed the exile. "I do
not think you would have done very differently
if you had been in my position. I was jealous
of the fiend, I suppose, and I didn't know but
what he would insist upon doing some of the
courting&mdash;which would have been intolerable."</p>

<p>"Better that than to be set down by your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> as a heartless trifler," returned Hopkins.
"But what happened next? Was the old
gentleman hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not he," replied the exile. "When he and
I, as he supposed me to be, reached the bottom
of the stairs he landed on top, and was the first
to get on his feet again. And then, Hopkins,
I was glad not to be in my normal condition;
for as the fiend attempted to rise my Arabella's
father, who still retained his grip upon that
oak stick, gave me the worst licking I ever had
in my life, and I&mdash;well, I really enjoyed the
spectacle, because I knew that I deserved it.
The fiend, hampered somewhat by the corse to
which he was not yet entirely accustomed was
at a tremendous disadvantage, and I know Mr.
Hicksworthy-Johnstone's blows caused him
considerable pain. The only possible escape
for him was to leave the body, which he did
just as the attacking party landed a resounding
thwack upon the back of my neck. Of course,
the minute the fiend evacuated the premises, I
appeared to Mr. Hicksworthy-Johnstone to
have been killed, because there was in reality
no slightest bit of animation left in my body.
It was the horror of this discovery that covered
the retreat of the fiend, who, more horribly
green than ever&mdash;the green that comes from
rage&mdash;mounted the steps he had so summarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
descended a moment before, and hurried into
my room, dragging me by sheer force of will,
which I was unable to resist, after him. You
see, Hopkins, we were now nothing more than
two consciousnesses; two minds, one mortal,
the other immortal; one infinitely strong, the
other finite in its limitations, and I was of
course as powerless in the presence of the
fiend as a babe in the arms of its nurse. Mr.
Hicksworthy-Johnstone, thinking that he had
killed me, after a vain endeavour to restore my
stricken body to consciousness&mdash;in which he
would have succeeded had the fiend permitted
me to take possession again, for I did not wish
Arabella's father to suppose for one instant
that he was a murderer&mdash;sneaked on tip-toes
from the building, and, mumbling to himself in
an insane fashion, disappeared in the crowd of
pedestrians on the street.</p>

<p>"'This is a pretty mess you've got us into,'
said the fiend. 'I should like to know what
excuse you can have for such infernal duplicity
as you have been guilty of?'</p>

<p>"'I cannot discuss this matter with you,' I
answered. 'The duplicity is not mine, but
yours. You have endeavoured to exercise
rights which were clearly not yours to exercise.
I informed you that in matters of love&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Matters of love!' he ejaculated. 'Do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
call this a matter of love? Do you think it's
a matter of love for an entire stranger to throw
a two-pound crystal inkstand loaded with ink
at the very core of my waistcoat? Is it a
matter of love for a grey-haired villain like that
to drag me or you, whichever way you choose
to put it, down a flight of stairs and then knock
the life out of us? It seems to me, you have a
strange idea of love.'</p>

<p>"'Don't you understand!' I cried. 'That
man was only doing his duty. He is Arabella's
father!'</p>

<p>"'Again, I must ask,' said the fiend, in a
manner that aggravated me as it had aggravated
the old gentleman, 'who, in all creation, is
Arabella?'</p>

<p>"'My <i>fianc&eacute;e!</i>' I yelled. 'My <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, you
poor blind omniscient! Whom did you
suppose?'</p>

<p>"As I uttered these words, Hopkins, the
fiend's whole manner changed. He was no
longer flustered and angry merely; he was a
determined and very angry being. He rose
from his chair, and fixing his eye upon the
point where he thought I was&mdash;and he had
a faculty of establishing that point accurately
at all times&mdash;and pointing that horrible finger
of his at me, fairly hissed with rage.</p>

<p>"'That settles it, sir,' he cried. 'You and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I part for ever. You, by your foolish perversity,
by your inexplicable lack of candour, by your
sinful refusal to trust your welfare to my hands,
who have done so much for you, have nearly
overthrown the whole structure of the greatness
I have builded up. Your idiotic behaviour has
decided me to do that which from the very
beginning I have most feared. I have been
haunted by the fear that you would want to
marry some woman simply for the empty,
mortal reason that you loved her, utterly
ignoring the fact that by a judicious matrimonial
step you could attain to heights that
otherwise could never be yours. Having your
interests entirely in view, I had arranged a
match which would strengthen into permanence
your, at present, rather uncertain hold upon
society. Lady Ariadne Maude Fackleton, to
whom you are at present engaged, as the
daughter of the Earl of Pupley, can give you
the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the best circles in London or out
of it; while this Arabella of yours can serve
only to assist you in spending your income and
keeping your parlour free from dust. Now,
what earthly use was there in your philandering&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I fancy I have a right to select my own
wife,' I said.</p>

<p>"'You always were strong on fancies,' he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
retorted. 'You might have known that with
the career opening up before you a plain
Arabella would never do. Do you suppose you
could take her to a ball at the Earl of
Mawlberry's? Do you suppose that any
woman, in fact, who would consent to marry
you as your weak inefficient self could go anywhere
and do me justice? I guess not; and
your behaviour has settled our partnership for
ever. We part for good.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I'm glad of it,' I retorted, goaded
to anger by his words. 'Get out. I don't
want to see you again. You've ruined me by
putting me in false positions from the time we
met until now, and I am sick of it. You can't
leave too soon to suit me.'</p>

<p>"When I had spoken these words he darted
one final venomous glance at me, and walked
whistling from the room. As long as his
whistle was perceptible I remained quiet&mdash;quiet
as my agitation would permit; and then,
when the last flute-like note died away in the
distance, I floated from the room and down
the stairs to get my poor bruised body and put
it in shape to call on Arabella.</p>

<p>"Hopkins, when I reached the foot of the
stairs my body had disappeared! I was
frantic with fear. I did not know whether it
had been found by the janitor and conveyed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the morgue, whether Arabella's father had
returned to conceal it, and so conceal his fancied
crime, or whether the fiend had finally crowned
his infamous work by stealing it. I sought for
it in vain. Forgetful of my invisibility, I asked
the janitor if he had seen it, and he fled shrieking
with fear from the building, and declined
ever thereafter to enter it again. Every nook
and corner in the Temple I searched and found
it not, and then I floated dejectedly to Arabella's
home, where I found her embracing her father
in a last fond farewell. The old gentleman was
about leaving the country to escape the consequences
of his crime.</p>

<p>"'Arabella!' I cried, as I entered the
room.</p>

<p>"The girl turned a deadly white, and her
father fell cringing upon his knees, and then I
realized that, recognizing my voice, they feared
my ghost had come to haunt them, and with
this realization came to my consciousness the
overwhelming thought that both would go
insane were I to persist in speaking while
invisible.</p>

<p>"The situation, Hopkins, was absolutely
terrible, and if I had had my teeth I should
have gnashed them for the very helplessness of
my condition."</p>

<p>"Did the old gentleman persist in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
determination to leave the country?" asked
Hopkins.</p>

<p>"He did. He sailed for the United States
on a small freight schooner that night, and
reached New York in time to hear in that far-off
clime of the marriage of his supposed
victim; but I must not anticipate," said the
exile.</p>

<p>"For three weeks after that horrible day I
never caught sight of my missing person, nor
did I discover the slightest clue as to its
whereabouts. It never turned up at my
quarters that I could learn, but that it was not
dead or buried I had good reason to believe;
for one morning, while I was away from my
rooms floating along Rotten Row, hoping to
catch sight of myself if perchance I still lived,
four truckmen arrived at the Temple here and
moved all my clothes and furniture, whither I
never discovered, in consequence of which act,
upon my return here, I found the room cold
and bare as a barn."</p>

<p>"That was rank robbery," said Toppleton.</p>

<p>"We should have trouble in establishing
that fact in court," returned the exile. "I could
not deny on oath that my hand had penned
the order for the removal of the goods, and as
for the clothes and other things, most of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had been bought by the money I had earned
through the fiend's instrumentality."</p>

<p>"That is so," said Toppleton, hastily acquiescing
in the exile's words, lest he should
seem to his visitor less acute than a full-fledged
lawyer should be. "And how long was it
before you encountered yourself once more?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks," returned the exile. "And
where do you suppose the meeting took
place?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Hopkins. "At Buckingham
Palace?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. In Arabella's parlour! It was
just three weeks from the hour in which Mr.
Hicksworthy-Johnstone appeared at my office
door in the Temple that, for the want of something
better to do, I floated into Arabella's
parlour again, and was filled with consternation
to see standing there before the mirror,
adjusting his tie, the fiend in full possession of
my treasured self. I was about to utter a cry
of delight when I heard an ejaculation of fear
behind me, and turning saw Arabella herself
entering the room, pale as a sheet. I tell you
Hopkins, it was dramatic; though, as far as the
fiend was concerned, he was as nonchalant as
could be.</p>

<p>"'You are not dead!' cried Arabella,
hoarsely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Not that I am aware of, madam,' said the
fiend coolly.' Have I the honour of addressing
Miss Arabella Hicksworthy-Johnstone?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Edward, Edward,' she cried&mdash;'I forgot
to tell you, Hopkins,' explained the spirit, 'my
name was Edward'&mdash;'oh, Edward, what does
this mean?' she cried. 'My father has fled to
America, thinking that in that unhappy
moment of Saturday three weeks ago he had
killed you.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed!' returned the fiend. 'I sincerely
hope he will enjoy the trip, though he
did inflict injuries upon me from which I shall
be a long time in recovering. But tell me,
madame, are you Miss Arabella Hicksworthy-Johnstone?'</p>

<p>"'Edward,' she replied, 'are you mad?'</p>

<p>"'I have a right to be indignant at your
father's treatment of me, if that vilely vindictive
old person was your father, but I am not
what you might call mad. I cherish no vindictive
feelings. But as my time is limited I
should like to proceed at once to the business
I have in hand, if you will permit me.'</p>

<p>"Arabella sat aghast as the man she deemed
her <i>fianc&eacute;</i> spoke these words to her. She
was utterly unable to comprehend the situation,
and I could not clarify the cloud upon her
understanding without imperilling her reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Oh, Hopkins, Hopkins, were the fires of Hades
to become extinguished to-day, there are other
tortures for the spirit close at hand more
hideously unbearable even than they!"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," said Hopkins. "If I
had my choice between your experience and
Hades, I think I should warm up to the latter.
But go on. What did Arabella say?"</p>

<p>"She drew herself up proudly after a moment
of hesitation, and said, 'I have no desire to
hinder you in going about your business.'</p>

<p>"'Thanks,' said the fiend. 'Assuming that
you are Miss Arabella Hicksworthy-Johnstone,
I would say to you that I should like to know
upon what your father's claim that you and I
are engaged rests.'</p>

<p>"'Really, Edward,' she returned impatiently,
'I cannot comprehend your singular behaviour
this afternoon. You know how we became
engaged. You know you asked me to be your
wife, and you know that after keeping you on
your knees for several hours I consented.'</p>

<p>"'Madam,' observed the fiend, 'I never
went on my knees to a woman in my life. I
never asked but one woman in this world to be
my wife, and you are not she.'</p>

<p>"'What!' cried Arabella. 'Do you mean
to say to me, Edward, that you did <i>not</i> ask me
to be your wife?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I meant to say exactly what I said. That
I am engaged to be married to Lady Ariadne
Maude Fackleton, daughter of the Earl of
Pupley, the only woman to whom I ever spoke
or thought of speaking a word of love in my
life. I mean to say that Lady Ariadne Maude
Fackleton and I expect to be married before
the month is up. I mean to say that I never
saw you before in my life, and I should like to
know what your intentions are concerning this
absurd claim that I am engaged to you may be,
for I do not intend to have my future marred
by any breach of promise suits. In short,
madam, do you intend to claim me as your
matrimonial prize or not? If not, all well
and good. If so, I shall secure an injunction
restraining you from doing anything of the sort.
Even should you force me to the altar itself I
should then and there forbid the banns.'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said my Arabella, drawing herself up
like a queen, 'you may leave this house, and
never set foot again within its walls. I should
as soon think of claiming that celebrated biblical
personage, of whom you remind me, Ananias,
for a husband as you. Do not flatter yourself
that I shall ever dispute the Lady Ariadne's
possession of so accomplished a lord and master
as yourself,&mdash;though I should do so were I
more philanthropically disposed. If it be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
duty of one woman to protect the happiness
of another, I should do all that lies in my
power to prevent this marriage; but inasmuch
as my motive in so doing would, in all likelihood,
be misconstrued, I must abstain; I
must hold myself aloof, though the whole
future happiness of one of my own sex be
at stake. Farewell, sir, and good riddance.
If you will leave me Lady Ariadne's address,
I will send her my sympathy as a wedding
gift.'</p>

<p>"'Madam,' returned the fiend, bowing low,
'your kind words have taken a heavy load from
my heart. You deserve a better fate; but farewell.'</p>

<p>"Then as the fiend departed Arabella swooned
away. My first impulse was to follow the
fiend, and to discover if possible his address;
but I could not bring myself to leave Arabella
at that moment, she was so overcome. I floated
to the prostrate woman, and whispered the love
I felt for her in her ear.</p>

<p>"'Arabella,' I said. 'Arabella&mdash;my love&mdash;it
is all a mistake. Open your eyes and see. I
am here ready to explain all if you will only
listen.'</p>

<p>"Her answer was a moan and a fluttering of
the eyelids.</p>

<p>"'Arabella,' I repeated. 'Don't you hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
me, sweetheart? Open your eyes and look at
me. It is I, Edward.'</p>

<p>"'Edward!' she gasped, her eyes still closed.
'What <i>does</i> it all mean? Why have you treated
me so?'</p>

<p>"'It is not I who have done this Arabella; it
is another vile being over whose actions I have
no control. He is a fiend who has me in his
power. He is&mdash;oh, Arabella, do not ask me, do
not insist upon knowing all, only believe that
I am not to blame!'</p>

<p>"'Kiss me, Edward,' she murmured. 'One
little kiss.'</p>

<p>"Hopkins," moaned the exile, "just think
of that! One little kiss was all she asked, and
I&mdash;I hadn't anything to kiss her with&mdash;not
the vestige of a lip.</p>

<p>"'Kiss me, Edward,' she repeated.</p>

<p>"'I cannot,' I cried out in anguish.</p>

<p>"'Why not?' she demanded, sitting up on
the floor and gazing wildly around her, and
then seeing that she was absolutely alone in
the room, and had been conversing with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" ejaculated Hopkins, wringing his
hands. "Dear me! The poor girl must have
been nearly crazy."</p>

<p>"Nearly, Hopkins?" said the exile, in a
sepulchral tone. "Nearly? Arabella never
did anything by halves or by nearlies. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
became quite crazy, and as far as I know has
remained so until this day, for with the restoration
of consciousness, and the shock of opening
her eyes to see nothing that could speak with
her, and yet had spoken, her mind gave way,
and she fled chattering like an imbecile from the
room. I have never seen her since!"</p>

<p>"And the fiend?" queried Toppleton.</p>

<p>"I saw him at St. George's on the following
Wednesday," returned the exile. "I had
been wandering aimlessly and distractedly about
London for four days since the dreadful episode
at Arabella's, when I came to St. George's
Church. There was an awning before the door,
and from the handsome equipages drawn up
before the edifice I knew that some notable
function was going on within. The crowds,
the usual London crowds, were being kept
back by the police, but I, of course, being invisible,
floated over their heads, past the
guards, through the awning into the church.
There was a wedding in progress, and the
groom's back seemed familiar, though I could
not place it at first, and naturally, Toppleton,
for it was my own, as I discovered, a moment
later. When the last irrevocable words binding
me to a woman I had never before seen had
been spoken, and the organ began to peal
forth the melodious measures of the Lohengrin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
March, the bride and groom, made one, turned
and faced the brilliant assemblage of guests,
among whom were the premier and the members
of his cabinet, and as complete a set of
nabobs, mentioned in Burke, as could be
gathered in London at that time of the year,
and I recognized my own face wreathed in
smiles, my own body dressed in wedding garb,
standing on the chancel steps ready to descend.</p>

<p>"I was married, Hopkins, at last. Married
to a woman of beauty and wealth and high
position, utterly unknown to me, and not only
were my own mother and my best friends
absent, but I myself had only happened in by
accident.</p>

<p>"My rage knew no bounds, and as the fiend
and his bride passed down the aisle amid the
showered congratulations of the aristocratic
multitude, I impotently endeavoured to strike
him, of which he was serenely unconscious; but
as he left the church my voice, which had been
stifled with indignation, at last grew clear, and
I howled out high above the crowds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You vile scoundrel, restore me to myself!
Give me back the presence of which you have
robbed me, or may every curse in all the
universe fall upon you and your house for
ever.'</p>

<p>"He heard me, Toppleton, and his answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was a smile&mdash;a green smile&mdash;seeing which his
bride, the Lady Ariadne Maude Fackleton,
fainted as they drove away.</p>

<p>"That, Hopkins, is substantially the tale of
villainy I have come to tell. Little remains to
be told. The fiend has been true to his promise
to make me famous, for every passing
year has brought some new honour to my name.
I have been elevated to the peerage; I have
been ambassador to the most brilliant courts of
Europe; I have been all that one could hope
to be, and yet I have not been myself. I ask
your assistance. Will you not give it to me?"</p>

<p>"Edward," said Toppleton warmly, "I will.
I will be candid with you, Edward. I am
almost as ignorant of law as a justice of the
peace, but for your sake I will study and see
what can be done. I will fight your case for
you to the very last, but first tell me one
thing. Your name is what?"</p>

<p>"Edward Pompton Chatford."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Toppleton, "the famous
novelist?"</p>

<p>"He made me so," said the exile.</p>

<p>"And the fiend's present title is?"</p>

<p>"Lord Barncastle of Burningford."</p>

<p>"He?" said Toppleton, incredulously, recognizing
the name as that of one who fairly bent
beneath the honours of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"None other," returned the exile.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" ejaculated Toppleton. "How
Morley, Harkins, Perkins, Mawson, Bronson,
Smithers, and Hicks will open their eyes when
I tell them that I have been retained to institute
<i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings in the case of
Chatford v. Barncastle of Burningford! Morley
particularly, I am afraid will die of fright!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TOPPLETON CONSULTS THE LAW AND FORMS AN OPINION.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">At</span> the conclusion of the exile's story Hopkins
glanced at his watch, and discovered that he
had barely time to return to his lodging and
dress for a little dinner he had promised to
attend that evening.</div>

<p>"I will look up the law in this case of yours,
Chatford," he said, rising from his chair and
putting on his hat and coat, "and in about a
week I rather think we shall be able to decide
upon some definite line of action. It will be
difficult, I am afraid, to find any precedent to
guide us in a delicate matter of this sort, but
as a lay lawyer, if I may be allowed the expression,
it seems to me that there ought to be
some redress for one who has been made the
victim of so many different kinds of infamy at
once as you have. The weak part of our case
is that you were yourself an accessory to every
single one of the fiend's crimes, and in instituting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a suit at law we cannot get around the
fact that in a measure you are both plaintiff
and defendant. I believe those are the terms
usually employed to designate the two parties
to a suit, except in the case of an appeal, when
there is an appellant and a repellant if my
memory serves me."</p>

<p>"It may be as you say," returned the exile,
sadly. "I'll have to take your word for it
entirely, since, as I have already told you, all
the law I ever knew I have forgotten, and then,
too, my business being purely one of adjudication,
I used to distinguish my clients one from
another&mdash;representing, as I did, both sides&mdash;by
calling them, respectively, the compromisee
and the compromisor."</p>

<p>"Well," Toppleton said, "I'll find out all
about it and let you know, say, by Friday next.
We'll first have to decide in what capacity
you shall appear in court, whether as a plaintiff
or defendant. I think under the circumstances
you will have to go as a plaintiff, though in a
case in which my father was interested some
years ago, I know that it was really the plaintiff
who was put on the defensive as soon as the
old gentleman took him in hand to cross-examine
him. It was said by experts to have
been the crossest examination on the calendar
that year; and between you and me, Edward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the plaintiff never forgave his attorneys for not
retaining the governor on his side in the beginning.
If you would rather go as a defendant,
I suppose I could arrange to have it so, but it
strikes me as a disadvantageous thing to do in
these days, because in most cases, it is the
defendant who has committed the wrong upon
which the suit is based, and a man who starts
in as the underdog, has to combat the prejudices
of judge, jury and general public, with whom it
is a time-honoured custom to believe a man
guilty until he has proven his innocence. I
think, on the whole, it would be easier for you
to prove Lord Barncastle's guilt than your own
innocence."</p>

<p>"I know from the lucid manner in which you
talk, Toppleton," said the exile, with a deep
sigh indicating satisfaction, "from the readiness
and extemporaneousness with which you grasp
the situation, not losing sight of side issues,
that I have made no mistake in coming to you.
Heaven bless you, sir. You will never regret
the assistance you are so nobly giving to one
you have never seen."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, Sallie&mdash;I should say
Chatford," said Toppleton. "I am an American
citizen and will ever be found championing the
cause of the oppressed against the oppressor.
My ears are ever open to the plaint of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
plaintiff, nor shall I be deaf to the defendant in
case you choose to be the latter. Count on me,
Edward, and all will yet be well!"</p>

<p>With these inspiring words, Toppleton lit
his cigar and walked jauntily from the room,
and the exile relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Faithful to his promise, Toppleton applied
himself assiduously to the study of the law as
it seemed to him to bear upon the case of his
mysterious client. To be sure, his library was
not quite as extensive as it might have been,
and there may have been points in other books
than the ones he had, which would have affected
his case materially, but the young lawyer was
more or less self-reliant, and what he had to
read he read intelligently.</p>

<p>"If I were called upon suddenly to rescue a
young woman from drowning, and possessed
nothing but an anchor and a capstan bar to do
it with, my duty clearly would be to do the
best I could with those tools, however awkward
they might be. I could not ease my conscience
after neglecting to do all that I could with those
tools, by saying that I hadn't a lifeboat and
a cork suit handy. Here is a parallel case. I
must do the best I can with the tools I have,
and I guess I can find enough law in Blackstone
and that tree calf copy of the sixteenth volume
of Abbott's 'Digest' I picked up the other day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to cover this case. If I can't, I'll have to use
the sense that Nature gave me, and go ahead
anyhow."</p>

<p>To his delight, Hopkins found it utterly unnecessary
for him to read the tree calf sixteenth
volume of Abbott's "Digest," he found so much
in the "Comic Blackstone" that applied.</p>

<p>"Why, do you know," he said to the exile
when they met, the one to explain the law, the
other to listen, "do you know you have the
finest case in all Christendom, without leaving
the very fundamental principles of the law?
It's really extraordinary what a case you have,
or rather, would have, if you could devise some
means of appearing in court. That's the uncrackable
nut in the case. How the deuce to
have you appear on the witness stand, I can't
see. The court would not tolerate any such
makeshift as the Aunt Sallie scheme you and I
have adopted, it would be so manifestly absurd,
and would give the counsel for the defence&mdash;for
you must be the plaintiff after all, can't
help yourself&mdash;it would give the counsel for the
defence the finest chance to annihilate us by
the use of his satirical powers he had ever had,
and before a jury that would simply ruin our
cause at the outset."</p>

<p>"I don't see why I can't testify as I am&mdash;bodiless
as I have been left. The mere absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of my body and presence of my consciousness
would almost prove my case," said the exile.</p>

<p>"It would seem as if it ought to," said
Toppleton. "But you know what men are.
They believe very little that they hear, and not
much more than half that they see. You
couldn't expect anyone to believe the points of
a person unseen. If they can't see you they
can't see your hardships, and besides, hearsay
evidence unsupported is not worth shucks."</p>

<p>"I don't know what shucks are," returned
the exile, "but I see your point."</p>

<p>"It's a serious point," said Toppleton.
"And then there is another most embarrassing
side to it. We can't afford to have our case
weakened by putting ourselves in a position
where countercharges can be brought against
us, and I am very much afraid our opponents
would charge vagrancy against you, for the
very obvious and irrefutable reason that you
have absolutely no visible means of support.
You wouldn't have a leg to stand on if they did
that, and yet it does seem a pity that something
cannot be done to enable you to appear,
for as I said a minute ago, you have otherwise
a perfectly magnificent cause of action. Why,
Edward, there isn't a page in the Comic
Blackstone that does not contain something
that applies to your case, and that ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
make you a winner if we could get around this
horrible lack of body of yours.</p>

<p>"For instance," continued Toppleton, opening
A'Beckett's famous contribution to legal
lore, "in the very first chapter we find that
Blackstone divides rights into rights of <i>persons</i>
and rights of things. Clearly you have a right
to your own person, and no judge on a sane
bench would dare deny it. Absolute rights, it
says here, belong to man in a state of nature,
which being so, you have been wronged,
because in being deprived of your state of
nature you have been robbed of your absolute
rights. Clear as crystal, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said the exile. "You are a
marvel at law, Hopkins."</p>

<p>"In section six reference is made to the
<i>habeas corpus</i> act of Charles the Second, and
unless I have forgotten my Latin, that
is a distinct reference to a man's right
to the possession of his own body. Section
eight, same chapter, announces man's right
to personal security, and asserts his legal
claim to the enjoyment of <i>life, limbs, health and
reputation</i>. Have you enjoyed your life? No!
Have you enjoyed your limbs? Not for thirty
years. Have you enjoyed your health. No!
Barncastle of Burningford has enjoyed that as
well as your reputation. I think on the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
though, we would better not say anything
about your reputation if we get into court, for
while it is undoubtedly <i>yours</i>, and has been by
no means enjoyed by you, you didn't make it
for yourself. That was his work, and he is
entitled to it."</p>

<p>"True," said the exile. "I do not wish to
claim anything I am not entitled to."</p>

<p>"That's the proper spirit," said Toppleton.
"You want what belongs to you and nothing
more. You are entitled to your property, for
which section eleven of this same chapter
provides, saying that the law will not allow a
man to be deprived of his property except by
the law itself. If a man's own body isn't his,
I'd like to know to whom it belongs in a
country that professes to be free!"</p>

<p>Toppleton paused at this point to make a
few notes and to reinforce his own spirit by
means of others.</p>

<p>"Now, under the head of real property,
Chatford," he said, "I find that in England
property is real or personal. I think that in
this case, that of which you have been deprived
comes under both heads. One's body
is certainly real and unquestionably personal,
and if a man has a right to the possession of
each, he has a right to the possession of both,
and he who robs him of both is guilty of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
crime under each head. Real property consists
of lands, tenements and hereditaments.
Lands we must perforce exclude because you
have lost no lands. Tenements may be
alluded to, however, with absolute fairness
because the body is the tenement of the soul.
Of hereditaments I am not sure. I don't
know what hereditaments are, and I haven't
had time to find out anything about them
except that they are corporeal or incorporeal,
which leads me to infer that you have been
wronged under this head also, for I must
assume that a hereditament is something that
may or may not have a body according to
circumstances, which is your case exactly.</p>

<p>"Now a man's right to the possession of an
estate is called his title, if I am not mistaken,"
continued Hopkins, "and it is only reasonable
to suppose that this refers to bodily estate as
well as to landed estate. What we must
dispute is Barncastle's title to your bodily
estate. Our case is referred to in section two,
chapter nine, part second of this book, which
deals with joint tenancy in which two or more
persons have one and the same interest in an
estate, but it must be held by both at the same
time. Now, even granting, as the other side
may say, that you entered into a partnership
with the fiend, we could knock him right off his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
pins on the sole fact that in declining to admit
you to your own bodily estate, he has not only
deprived you of an undoubted right, but has in
reality forfeited his own claim to possession,
since he has violated the only principle of law
upon which he could claim entrance to the
estate under any circumstances."</p>

<p>"Superb!" ejaculated the exile.</p>

<p>"Now we come to an apparent difficulty,"
continued Hopkins. "Possession is, according
to my authority, five points of the law.
The fiend has possession, and in consequence
tallies five points; out of how many I do not
know. What the maximum number of points
in the law is, the book does not say, but even
assuming that they form a good half, I think we
can bring forward five more with a dozen substitutes
for each of the five in support of our
position. Some of these points will evolve
themselves when we come to consider whence
Barncastle's title was derived.</p>

<p>"Did he acquire his title by descent? No;
unless it was by a descent to unworthy tricks
which, I fear, are outside of the meaning of the
law. By purchase? If so, let him show a receipt.
By occupancy? Yes, and by a forcible occupancy
which was as justifiable as his occupation of
the throne would be, an occupancy which can be
shown in court to be an entire subversion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
right of a prior occupant whose title was
acquired by inheritance."</p>

<p>"That's a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stong'">strong</ins> point," said the exile.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Hopkins, "especially in a
country where birth means so much. But that
isn't all we have to say on this question of title.
A title can be held by prescription. Barncastle
may claim that he got his this way, but we
can meet that by showing that he compounded
his own prescription, and originally got you to
swallow it by a trick. He also has a title by
alienation, and there I think we may be weak
since you were a party to the final alienation,
though we may be able to pull through on even
that point by showing that you consented only
in the expectation of an early return of the
premises. It was an alienation by deed, an
innocent deed on your part, an infamous one
on his. It was not an alienation of record,
which weakens his claim, but one of special
custom, which by no means weakens yours.</p>

<p>"And so, Edward, we might go on through
the whole subject of the right of property, and
on every point we are strong, and on few can
Barncastle of Burningford put in the semblance
of a defence."</p>

<p>"It's simply glorious," said the exile. "I
don't believe there ever was a case like it."</p>

<p>"I don't believe so either," said Toppleton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
"And on the whole I'm glad there never was.
I should hate to think that a crime like this
could ever become a common one.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, resuming the discussion of
the legal aspect of the exile's case, "let us
see what we can find under the head of 'Private
and Public Wrongs and their Remedies!' I
suppose yours would come under the head of a
civil wrong, though your treatment has been
very far from civil. As such your redress lies
in the Courts. You are forbidden to take back
what has been taken from you by a force which
amounts to a breach of the peace,&mdash;that is, it
would not be lawful for you to seize your own
body and shake the life out of it for the purpose
of yourself becoming once more its animating
spirit.</p>

<p>"First we must decide, 'What is the wrong
that has been put upon you?' Well, it's
almost any crime you can think of. He has dispossessed
you of that which is yours. He has
ousted you from your freehold. He has been
guilty of trespass. He has subjected you to a
nuisance, that is if it is a nuisance to be deprived
of one's body, and I should think it would so
appear to any sane person. He has been
guilty of subtraction. He has subtracted you
from your body and your body from you, leaving
apparently no remainder. He has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
guilty of an offence against your religion. To
an extent he has committed an offence against
the public health in that he has haunted
citizens of this city and caused you unwittingly
to do the same to the detriment of the sanity
of those who have been haunted. I think we
might even charge him with homicide, for if
depriving a man of thirty years of his corporeal
existence isn't depriving him of life, I don't
know what is. However this may be, I am
convinced that he is guilty of mayhem, for he
certainly has deprived you of a limb&mdash;that is
shown by your utter absence of limb. He has
been guilty of an offence against your habitation,
corporeal and incorporeal, and finally he
has been guilty of larceny both grand and petty.
Grand in the extent of it, petty in the method.
By Jove, Chatford, if we could bring you into
Court as a concrete individual, and not as an
abstract entity, we could get up an indictment
against Lord Barncastle of Burningford that
would quash him for ever.</p>

<p>"A body obtained for you, I should carry
the case to the Appellate Court at once, for two
reasons. First because it would not be appropriate
to try so uncommon a cause in the
Common Pleas, second because a decision by
the Court of Appeals is final, and we should
save time by going there at once; but the point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with which we must concern ourselves the most
is, how shall we bring you before the eyes of
the court; how shall we get our plaintiff into
shape&mdash;visible shape?"</p>

<p>A painful silence followed the conclusion of
Toppleton's discussion of the law in the case
of Chatford <i>v</i>. Barncastle of Burningford. It
was evident that the exile could think of no
means of surmounting the unfortunate barrier
to a successful prosecution of the case. Finally
the exile spoke:</p>

<p>"I perceive the dreadful truth of what you
say. Having no physical being, I have no
standing in court."</p>

<p>"That's the unfortunate fact," returned Hopkins.
"Can't you get a body in some way?
Can't you borrow one temporarily?"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the exile. "You are my
only material friend. You wouldn't lend me
yours."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," said Toppleton. "If I
did, where would your only material friend be?
It's hopeless, Edward; and now that I think of
it, even if you did get a form and should go
to court, where are your witnesses? You could
only assert, and Barncastle could always deny.
Strong as your cause is, the courts, under the
circumstances, will give you no redress, because
you cannot prove your case. We must seek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
other means; this is a case that requires diplomatic
action. Strategy will do more for us
than law, and I think I have a scheme."</p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>"I will go to Lord Barncastle, and by means
of a little clever dissembling will frighten him
into doing the right thing by you. I realize
what a tremendous undertaking it is, but
failure then would not mean public disgrace,
and failure in the courts would put us, and
particularly myself, under a cloud. In short,
we might be suspected of blackmail, Chatford;
Barncastle is so prominent, and liable to just
such attacks at all times."</p>

<p>"But how do you propose to reach him?
He has the reputation now of being the
haughtiest and most unapproachable member
of the aristocracy."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" laughed Hopkins. "You don't
understand Americans. Why, Chatford, we can
push ourselves in anywhere. If you were a
being like myself, and had ten pounds to bet, I
would wager you that within forty-eight hours I
could have an invitation in autograph from the
Prince of Wales himself to dine with him and
Prince Battenburg at Sandringham, at any
hour, and on any day I choose to set. You
don't know what enterprising fellows we
Yankees are. I'll know Lord Barncastle intimately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
inside of one month, if I once set out
to do it."</p>

<p>"Excuse me for saying it, Hopkins," said the
exile, sadly, "but I must say that what I have
liked about you in the past has been your
freedom from bluster and brag. To me these
statements of yours sound vain and empty. I
would speak less plainly were it not that my
whole future is in your hands, and I do not
want you to imperil my chances by rashness.
Tell me how you propose to meet Barncastle,
and, having met him, what you propose to do, if
you do not wish me to set this talk down as
foolish braggadocio."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how I propose to meet him,"
said Hopkins, slightly offended, and yet characteristically
forgiving; "but what I shall do after
that I shall not tell you, for I may find that he
is a politer person than you are, and it's just
possible that I shall like him. If I do, I may
be impelled to desert you and ally myself with
him. I don't like to be called a braggart,
Edward."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Hopkins," said the spirit. "I
am so wrought up by my hopes and fears,
by the consciousness of the terrible wrongs I
have suffered, that I hardly know what I am
saying."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," rejoined Hopkins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"Don't worry. The chances of my deserting you
are very slight. But to return to your question.
I shall meet Barncastle in this way; I shall
have a sonnet written in his praise by an intimate
friend of mine, a poet of very high standing
and little morality, which I shall sign
with my own name, and have printed as though
it were a clipping from some periodical. This
clipping I will send to Lord Barncastle with a
note telling him that I am an American admirer
of his genius, the author of the sonnet, and
have but one ambition, which I travelled from
America to gratify&mdash;to meet him face to face."</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the spirit. "An appeal to his
vanity, eh?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Toppleton. "It works
every time."</p>

<p>"And when you meet him?"</p>

<p>"We shall see," rejoined Toppleton. "I have
given up brag and bluster; but if Lord Barncastle
of Burningford does not take an interest
in Hopkins Toppleton after he has known him
fifteen minutes, I'll go back home to New York,
give up my law practice and become&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" said the spirit as Hopkins
hesitated.</p>

<p>"A sister of charity," said Hopkins, gravely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TOPPLETON MAKES A FAIR START.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A few</span> weeks later Toppleton was able to
report progress to his invisible client. He had
the sonnet to Barncastle of Burningford and
was much pleased with it, because, in spite of
the fact that it was two lines too long, he was
confident that it would prove very fetching to
the man to whom it was addressed.</div>

<p>"You ought to take out those two extra
lines, though," said the exile. "Barncastle is
a great stickler for form, and he will be antagonized
at once by your violation of the rules."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," returned Toppleton.
"Those lines stay right there, and I'll tell you
why. In the first place Barncastle, as an
Englishman, will see in the imperfect sonnet
something that will strike him as a bit of
American audacity, which will be very pleasing
to him, and will give him something to talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
about. As a Briton you are probably aware
that your countrymen are very fond of discovering
outrages of that sort in the work of
those over the sea, because it is a sort of convincing
proof that the American as a writer is
still an inferior, and that England's controlling
interest in the Temple of Immortality is in no
danger of passing into alien hands. In the
second place, he will be so pleased with the
extra amount of flattery that is crammed into
those two lines that he will not have the heart
to criticize them; and thirdly, as one who knows
it all, he will be prompted to send for me to
come to him, in order that he may point out to
me in a friendly spirit one or two little imperfections
in what he will call my otherwise
exquisite verse. I tell you what it is, Edward,"
said Toppleton, pausing a moment, "I never
devoted myself with any particular assiduity to
Latin, Greek, or mathematics, but when it
comes to human nature, I am, as we New
Yorkers say, a daisy, which means that I am
the flower upon which you may safely bet as
against the field."</p>

<p>"You certainly have an ingenious mind,
Hopkins," returned the exile, "and I hope it
will all go as you say, but I fear, Hopkins, I
fear."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," was Hopkins' confident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
reply, and being unable to do otherwise the
exile obeyed.</p>

<p>In three days the sonnet was printed, and so
fixed that it appeared to be a clipping from the
<i>Rocky Mountain Quarterly Review, a Monthly
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>"That'll strike him as another interesting
Americanism," said Hopkins, with a chuckle.
"There is no people on earth but my own
who would dare publish a quarterly twelve times
a year."</p>

<p>To the sonnet was appended the name
"Hopkins Parkerberry Toppleton;" Parkerberry
being a novelty introduced into the
signature by the young lawyer, not because he
was at all entitled to it, but for the proper
reason, as he said, that no American poet was
worth a nickel who hadn't three sections to his
name. A note with a distinctly western flavour
to it was penned, and with the "decoy" sonnet
went that night to Burningford Castle addressed
to "His Excellency, Lord Barncastle," and
then Toppleton and the exile sat down to await
the result.</p>

<p>They had not many days to wait, for within
a week of the dispatch of the poem and the
note Hopkins, on reaching the office one morning,
found the exile in a great state of excitement
over a square envelope lying on the floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
immediately under the letter slot Hopkins had
had made in the door.</p>

<p>"It's come, Hopkins, it's come!" cried the
exile.</p>

<p>"What's come?" queried Hopkins, calmly.</p>

<p>"The letter from Barncastle. I recognize
my handwriting. It came last night about five
minutes after you left the office, and I have been
in a fever of excitement to learn its contents
ever since. Do open it at once. What does
he say?"</p>

<p>"Be patient, Edward, don't get so excited.
Suppose you were to have an apoplectic
stroke!"</p>

<p>"I can't be patient, and I can't have apoplexy,
so do hurry. What do I say?"</p>

<p>"Seems to me," returned Hopkins, picking
up the letter and slowly opening it, "it seems
to me you are getting confused. But let's see;
what <i>does</i> Barncastle say? H'm!" he said,
reading the note. "'Barncastle Hall, Fenwick
Morton, Mascottonton-on-the-Barbundle,
December 19th, 189&mdash;. Hopkins Parkerberry
Toppleton, Esquire, 17, Temple, London.
Dear Sir,&mdash;I have to thank you for your favour
and enclosure of the 13th inst. Your sonnet is
but one of a thousand gratifying evidences I
am daily receiving that I have managed to win
to no inconsiderable degree the good will of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
your countrymen. It is also evidence to me
that you are a young man of much talent in the
line of original versification, since, apart from
the sentiment you express, your sonnet is one
of the most original I have ever seen, not only
for its length, but also for the wonderful mixture
of your metaphor. It is truly characteristic of
your great and growing country, and I cannot
resist your na&iuml;ve appeal to be permitted to
meet the unworthy object of its praise. I
should be gratified to have you to dinner at
Barncastle Hall, at eight o'clock on the evening
of December 23rd, 189&mdash;. Kindly inform me by
return post if your engagements will permit us
to have the pleasure of having you with us on
that evening. Believe me to be, with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sentitiments'">sentiments</ins>
of regard, ever, my dear sir, faithfully
yours, <span class="smcap">Barncastle</span>.'"</p>

<p>"By heavens!" ejaculated the exile, in
delighted accents, "you've got there, Hopkins,
you've got there. You'll go, of course?"</p>

<p>"Well, rather," returned Toppleton; "and
to carry out the illusion, as well as to pique his
interest in America, I'll wear a blue dress coat.
But first let me reply."</p>

<p>"Dear Barncastle," he wrote. "I'll be
there. Yours for keeps,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Toppleton</span>."</p>

<p>"How's that?" he asked, reading it aloud
to the exile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're not going to send that, are you?"
said the exile in disgust.</p>

<p>"I'm not, eh? Well just you watch me and
see," said Toppleton. "Why, Edward, that
will be the biggest <i>coup</i> of the lot. He will
get that letter, and he will be amused by it, and
the more he thinks of it the more he'll like it,
and then he'll say to himself, 'why, this man
is a character;' and then do you know what
will happen, Chatford?"</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I do," growled the exile.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you. He will invite all the
high panjandrums he knows to that dinner to
meet me, and he will tell them that I am an
original, and they'll all come, Chatford, just as
they would flock to see a seven-humped camel
or a dwarf eight feet high, and then I will have
Lord Barncastle of Burningford just where I
want him. I could browbeat him for weeks
alone and never frighten him, but once I let him
know that I know his secret, in the presence of
his wife and a brilliant company, <i>he</i> will be
apprehensive, and, if I mistake not, will be more
or less within my reach."</p>

<p>"Lady Barncastle is no longer living," said
the exile. "His household is presided over by
his daughter."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Hopkins. "We'll dazzle
the daughter too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this the way American lawyers do
business generally?" sneered the exile.</p>

<p>"No," returned Toppleton; "there is
probably not another American lawyer who
would take a case like yours. That's the one
respect in which they resemble your English
lawyers, but I'll tell you one thing. When
they start in to do a thing they do it, unless
their clients get too fresh, and then they stop
<i>in medias res</i>."</p>

<p>"I hope there is nothing personal in your
remarks, Hopkins," said the exile, uneasily.</p>

<p>"That all depends on you," retorted Hopkins.
"Despite your croakings and fears, the
first step we have taken has proven justifiable.
We have accomplished what we set out to
accomplish. I am invited to meet the fiend.
Score one point for us. Now, when I advance
a proposition for the scoring of a second point,
you sneer. Well, sneer. I'll win the case for
you, just to spite you. This despised note
posted to Barncastle, I shall order a blue dress
coat with brass buttons on it. I shall purchase,
if it is to be found in London, one of
those beaver hats on which the fur is knee
deep, a red necktie, and a diamond stud. My
trousers I shall have cut to fit the contour of
my calves like a glove. I shall sport the
largest silver watch to be found on the Strand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with a gold chain heavy enough to sustain a
weight of five hundred pounds; in short,
Chatford, you won't be able to distinguish me
from one of Teniel's caricatures of Uncle
Sam."</p>

<p>"You won't be able to deceive Barncastle
that way. He's seen New Yorkers before."</p>

<p>"Barncastle doesn't know I'm a New
Yorker, and he won't find it out. He thinks
I'm from the Rocky Mountains, and he knows
enough about geography to be aware that the
Rocky Mountains aren't within two hours' walk
of Manhattan Island. He knows that there is
a vast difference between a London gentleman
and a son of the soil of Yorkshire, and he
doesn't know but what there are a million
citizens of our great republic who go about
dressed up in fantastic garments similar to
those I shall wear to his dinner. If he is surprised,
his surprise will add to his interest, and
materially contribute to the pleasure of those
whom he invites to see the animal the untamed
poet of the Rockies. See?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," said the exile. "But clothes
won't make the illusion complete. You look
too much like a gentleman; your manners are
too polished. A man like Barncastle will see
through you in a minute."</p>

<p>"Again, Chatford, I am sorry that your possessions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
are nil, for I would like to wager you
that your noble other self will do nothing of
the sort. I have not been an amateur actor for
nothing, and as for manners I can be as bad
mannered as any nabob in creation if I try.
Don't you worry on that score."</p>

<p>The acceptance of Lord Barncastle's invitation
was therefore sent as Hopkins wrote it,
and the ensuing days were passed by the
young lawyer in preparing the extraordinary
dinner suit he had described to his anxious
client, who could hardly be persuaded that in
taking this step Toppleton was not committing
a bit of egregious folly. He could not comprehend
how Barncastle upon receipt of
Hopkins' note could be anything but displeased
at the familiarity of its tone. The idea of a
common untitled mortal like Toppleton even
assuming to be upon familiar terms with a
member of the aristocracy, and especially one
so high as Barncastle of Burningford, oppressed
him. He would as soon expect an
ordinary tradesman to slap the Prince of
Wales on the back, and call him by one of his
first names, without giving offence, as that
Barncastle should tolerate Toppleton's behaviour,
and he in consequence was fearful of
the outcome.</p>

<p>Toppleton, on the other hand, went ahead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with his extraordinary sartorial preparations,
serenely confident that the events of the next
few days would justify his course. The exile
was relieved to find that the plan was of
necessity modified, owing to Toppleton's inability
to find a typical Uncle Sam beaver in
London; but his relief was short-lived, for
Hopkins immediately proceeded to remedy
this defect by purchasing a green cotton
umbrella, which, he said, was perhaps better
than the hat as an evidence of eccentricity.</p>

<p>"If I cling to that umbrella all through
dinner, Chatford," said Toppleton, with a
twinkle in his eye, "preferring rather to part
with life, honour, or virtue than lose sight of it,
I will simply make an impression upon the
minds of that assembled multitude that they'll
not forget in a hurry."</p>

<p>"They'll think as I do," sighed the exile.
"They'll think you are a craz&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Toppleton, sharply.</p>

<p>"They'll think you are a genius," returned
the exile humbly and quickly too, fearing lest
Toppleton should take offence. "Have you&mdash;er&mdash;have
you considered what Barncastle's
servants will think of this strange performance?
They won't let you into the house, in the first
place," he added, to cover his retreat.</p>

<p>"I shall be admitted to the house by Barncastle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
himself; for I prophesy that his curiosity
to meet this Rocky Mountain poet will be so
great that he will be at the railway station to
greet me in person. Besides," continued
Toppleton, "why should I care what his
servants think? I never had nor ever knew
any one who had a servant whose thoughts were
worth thinking. A servant who can think
becomes in my country a servant of the people,
not the lackey of the individual. Furthermore, I
am after high game, and servants form no part
of my plan. They are not in it. When I go out
on a lion hunt I don't bother my head about or
waste my ammunition upon beasts of burden.
I am loaded to the muzzle for the purpose of
bringing down Barncastle. If he can't be
brought down without the humbling of his
butler, why, then, his butler must bite the dust.
If I become an object of suspicion to the
flunkies, I shall not concern myself about it
unless they become unpleasant, and if they
become unpleasant I shall corrupt them. I'll
buy every flunkey in the house, if it costs a five-pound
note."</p>

<p>"Well, go your own gait," said the exile, not
much impressed by Toppleton's discourse. "If
you are not clapped into a lunatic asylum, I
shall begin to believe that the age of miracles is
still extant; not that <i>I</i> think you crazy, Hopkins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but these others do not know you as well as I
do. For my part, I think that by going to
Barncastle's as your own handsome, frank,
open-hearted self, you will accomplish more
than you will in this masquerade."</p>

<p>"Your flattery saves your cause," said
Hopkins. "I cannot be indignant, as I ought,
with a man who calls me handsome, frank, and
open-hearted, but you must remember this: in
spite of your long absence from your body, you
retain all the commonplace weakness of your
quondam individuality. You would have me
do the commonplace thing you yourself would
have done thirty years ago. If there is a
common, ordinary, uninteresting individual in
the world, it is the handsome, frank, and open-hearted
man. You find him everywhere&mdash;in
hut and in palace, in village, town, and city.
He is the man who goes through life unobserved,
who gets his name in the paper three times in
his lifetime, and always at somebody else's
expense. Once when he is born, once when he
marries, and once when he dies, and it is a paid
advertisement, not an earned one, each time.
The first is paid for by his parents, the second
by his father-in-law, the third by his executors.
People like him well enough, but no one ever
cares enough about him to hate him. His conversation
ranges from babies&mdash;if he has any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
himself&mdash;through the weather to politics.
Beyond these subjects he has nothing to say,
and he rarely dines out, save with the parson,
the candidate, or the man who wants to get
the best of him in a business transaction. He
is an idol at home, a zero abroad. Nobody is
interested in him, and he would as likely be
found dining with the Khedive of Egypt as with
Lord Barncastle, and I'll wager that, even if he
should in some mysterious manner receive an
invitation to lend his gracious presence to the
Barncastle board, he would be as little in
evidence as an object of interest as the scullery-maid.
Were I to accept your advice, Chatford,
Barncastle's guests would be bored, Barncastle
himself would be disappointed, and your chance
of ever becoming the animating spirit of your
own body would correspondingly diminish.
Only by a bold stroke is success to be obtained.
The means I am about adopting are revolting
to me as a man of taste, but for the sake of our
cause I am willing to stifle my natural desire to
appear as a gentleman, to sink my true individuality,
and to go as a freak."</p>

<p>"But why do you think you will succeed,
Hopkins? Even granting that you make a
first-class freak, has it really ever happened
that idiocy&mdash;I say idiocy here not to imply that
I think you are an idiot, understand me&mdash;has it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ever happened that a freak succeeds with us
where that better, truer standard which is represented
by you as you really are has failed?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly that way," replied Hopkins.
"But this has happened. Your Englishmen
have flocked by the tens of thousands to see,
and have been interested by an American Wild
West show, where tens of hundreds have
straggled in to witness the thoughtful
Shakespearian productions of our most intellectual
tragedians. Barncastle can have a
refined, quiet, gentlemanly appearing person
at his table three hundred and sixty-five times
a year. He can get what I am going to give
him but once in a lifetime, so say no more
about it. I am set in my determination to
stand or fall in the manner I have indicated."</p>

<p>"All right," said the exile. "I've nothing
more to say; but there's one thing mighty certain.
I'm going with you. I want to witness
your triumph."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Toppleton. "Come along.
But if you do, leave that infernal whistle of
yours home, or there'll be trouble."</p>

<p>"I'm hardly anything else but a whistle. I
can't help whistling, you know."</p>

<p>"Then there are only two things to be done.
You must either get yourself set to the tune
of Yankee Doodle, or stay right here. I'm not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
going to have my plans upset by any such buoy
like tootle-toot as you are when you get
excited."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, on the whole, I'd better stay
home."</p>

<p>"I think you had," said Toppleton. "You
would be sure to whistle before we were out of
the woods."</p>

<p>Hopkins and his invisible client had hardly
finished this interview when the tailor's boy
arrived, bringing with him the fantastic garments
Hopkins had ordered, and almost simultaneously
there came a second letter from
Barncastle of Burningford, which set many of
the exile's fears at rest, and gave Toppleton
good reason to believe that for the first part of
his plan all was plain sailing. Barncastle's
note was very short, but it was a welcome one,
for it acknowledged the receipt of Toppleton's
"characteristically American acceptance to
dine," and closed with an expression of Barncastle's
hope that Hopkins would become one
of his guests for the Christmas holidays at the
Hall.</p>

<p>"See, there!" said Hopkins, triumphantly.
"That is the way my plans work."</p>

<p>"You are a Napoleon!" ejaculated the
exile.</p>

<p>"Not quite," returned Hopkins, drily. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
won't have any Waterloo in mine; but say,
Edward, let's try on our Uncle Sam's."</p>

<p>"Let's!" echoed the exile. "I am anxious
to see how we look."</p>

<p>"There!" said Toppleton, ten minutes later,
as he grasped the green cotton umbrella, and
arrayed in the blue dress coat and red tie and
other peculiar features of the costume he had
adopted, stood awaiting the verdict of the
exile.</p>

<p>"You look it, Toppleton; but I think there is
one thing missing. Where is your chin
whisker?"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" ejaculated Hopkins, with a gesture
of impatience. "How could I forget that?
And it's too late now, for if there is one thing
a Yankee can't do, Chatford, it is to force a
goatee inside of forty-eight hours. I'll have to
cook up some explanation for that&mdash;lost it in
an Indian fight in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia,
or some equally plausible theory, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think that might work," said the exile, in
an acquiescent mood since the receipt of Barncastle's
second note.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," returned Hopkins.
"The little detail that there aren't any Indians
in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, doesn't affect
the result, of course. But tell me, Chatford, how
do I look?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like the very devil!" answered the exile
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Good," said Toppleton. "If I look like
him I've got Barncastle down, for if the devil is
not his twin brother, he is his master. In
either event I shall be a <i>persona grata</i> at the
court of Barncastle of Burningford."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT BARNCASTLE HALL.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Toppleton's</span> surmises as to Barncastle's
method of receiving him appeared to be correct,
for upon his arrival, green umbrella and carpet
bag in hand, at the Fenwick Merton station he
was met by no less a person than his host
himself, who recognized him at once.</div>

<p>"I knew it was you," said Barncastle, as he
held out his hand to grasp Toppleton's. "I
knew it was you as soon as I saw you. Your
carpet bag, and the fact that you are the only
person on the train who travelled first class,
were the infallible signs which guided me."</p>

<p>"And I knew you, Barncastle, the minute I
saw you," said Hopkins, returning the compliment,
"because you looked less like a lord
than any man on the platform. How goes it,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>The Englishman's countenance wore a
puzzled expression as Toppleton put the
question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"How goes it?" he repeated slowly. "How
goes what? The train?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," laughed Hopkins. "How goes it
is Rocky Mountain for how's things, all your
family well, and your creditors easy?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," said Barncastle with a smile.
"All is well with us, thank you. My daughter
is awaiting your coming with very great
interest; and as for my creditors, my dear sir,
I am really uncertain as to whether I have
any. My steward can tell you better than I
how they feel."</p>

<p>"It's a great custom, ain't it?" said Hopkins
with enthusiasm, "that of being dunned by
proxy, eh? I wish we could work it out my
way. If you don't ante up right off out in the
Mountains, your grocer comes around and
collects at the point of his gun, and if you pay
him in promises, he gives you back your change
in lead."</p>

<p>"Fancy!" said Barncastle. "How unpleasant
it must be for the poor."</p>

<p>"Poor!" laughed Toppleton; "there's none
of them in the Rockies. You don't get a
chance to get poor in a country where boys
throw nuggets at birds, and cats are removed
from back-yard fences with silver boot-jacks.
Ever been in the Rockies, Barncastle?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the lord, "I have not, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
if all you say is true, I should like to visit that
section very much."</p>

<p>"True, Barncastle?" said Toppleton, bristling
up. "Why, my dear lord, that if of yours
would have dug your grave out near Pike's
Peak."</p>

<p>"I meant no offence, my dear fellow,"
returned Barncastle, apologetically.</p>

<p>"No need to tell me that," said Toppleton,
affably. "The fact that you still survive
shows I knew it. What time is dinner? I'm
ravenous."</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock," replied Lord Barncastle,
looking at his watch. "It is now only
three."</p>

<p>"Phew!" ejaculated Toppleton. "Five
hours to wait!"</p>

<p>"I thought we might take a little drive
around the country until six, and then we could
return to the Hall and make ready for dinner,"
said Barncastle.</p>

<p>"That suits me," returned Toppleton.
"But I wish you'd send that gentleman with
the mutton-chop whiskers that drives your
waggon to the lunch counter and get me a
snack before we start."</p>

<p>"No," said Barncastle, ushering Toppleton
into his dog-cart. "We'll do better than that.
We'll give up the drive until later. I take you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
directly to the Hall, and send a cold bird and
a glass of wine to your apartment."</p>

<p>"Good!" ejaculated Toppleton, with a smack
of the lips. "You must live pretty near as fine
here as we do in our big hotels at home.
They're the only other places I know where
you can get your appetite satisfied at five
minutes' notice."</p>

<p>Toppleton and his host then entered the
carriage, and in a short time they reached the
Hall&mdash;a magnificently substantial structure,
with ivy-clad towers, great gables, large arched
windows looking out upon seductive vistas,
and an air of comfortable antiquity about it
that moved Hopkins' tongue to an utterance
somewhat at variance with his assumed
character.</p>

<p>"How beautiful and quiet it all is," he said,
gazing about him in undisguised admiration.
"A home like this, my lord, ought to make a
poet of a man. The very air is an inspiration."</p>

<p>Barncastle shrugged his shoulders and
laughed; and had Toppleton not been looking
in rapt silence out through the large bowed
window at the end of the hall they had entered,
along an avenue of substantial oak trees to the
silver waters of the Barbundle at its other end,
he might have seen a strange greenish light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
come into the eyes of his host, which would
have worried him not a little. He did not see
it, however, and in a moment he remembered
his mission and the means he had adopted to
bring it to a successful issue.</p>

<p>"It beats the deck!" he ejaculated, with a
nervous glance at Barncastle, fearful lest his
enthusiasm had led him to betray himself.</p>

<p>"I find it a pleasant home," said Barncastle,
quietly, ushering him into a spacious and
extremely comfortable room which Toppleton
perceived in a moment was the library, at the
other end of which was a large open fireplace,
large enough to accommodate a small family,
within whose capacious depths three or four
huge logs were blazing fiercely. Before the fire
sat a stately young woman, about twenty-five
years of age, who rose as the Lord of Burningford
and his guest entered.</p>

<p>As she approached Toppleton would have
given all he possessed to be rid of the abominable
costume he had on; and when the young
heiress of Burningford's eye rested upon the
fearfully green cotton umbrella, he felt as if
nothing would so have pleased his soul as the
casting of that adjunct to an alleged Americanism
into the fire; for Lady Alice was, if he
could judge from appearances, a woman for
whose good opinion any man might be willing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to sacrifice immortality itself. But circumstances
would not permit him to falter, and,
despite the fact that it hurt his self-respect to
do it, Hopkins remained true to the object he
had in view.</p>

<p>"Alice, this is Mr. Toppleton. My daughter,
Lady Alice Chatford, Mr. Toppleton," said
Barncastle.</p>

<p>"Howdy," said Hopkins, making an
awkward bow to Lady Alice. "She don't
need her title to show she's a lady," he added,
turning to Barncastle, who seemingly acquiesced
in all that he said.</p>

<p>"My friend Toppleton, my dear," said Barncastle,
"has paid me the compliment of travelling
all the way from his home in the Rocky
Mountains in the United States to see me. He
is the author of that wonderful sonnet I showed
you the other night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," said Lady Alice, with a
gracious smile, which won Toppleton's heart
completely, "it was delightful. Lord Barncastle
and I are great admirers of your genius,
Mr. Toppleton, and we sincerely hope that we
shall be able to make your stay with us here as
pleasant for you as it is for us."</p>

<p>Again Hopkins would have disappeared
through the floor had he been able to act upon
the promptings of his own good taste. It made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
him feel unutterably small to think that he had
come here, under the guise of an uncultivated,
boorish clod with poetical tendencies, to work
the overthrow of the genius of the house.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, his voice husky with
emotion. "I had not expected so cordial a
reception. In fact," he added, remembering
his true position, "I had a bet of ten to one
with a friend of mine who is doing the Lakes
this afternoon that I'd get frozen stiff by a
glance of your ladyship's eye. I'm mighty glad
I've lost the bet."</p>

<p>"He has some courtliness beneath his unpolished
exterior," said Lady Alice later, when
recounting the first interview between them to
some of her friends. "I quite forgave his
boorishness when he said he was glad to lose
his wager."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Toppleton," said his host, "if
you care to go to your apartment I will see that
you get what you want. Just leave your
umbrella in the coat room, and let Parker take
your bag up to your room."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Barncastle, old fellow," said the
Rocky Mountain poet, "I'll go to my room
gladly; but as for leaving that umbrella out of
my sight, or transferring the handle of that
carpet bag to any other hand than my own, I
can't do it. They're my treasures, my lady,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
he added, turning to Lady Alice. "That bag
and I have been inseparable companions for
eight consecutive years, and as for the umbrella
we haven't been parted for five. It's my protector
and friend, and since it saved my life in
a shooting scrape at the Papyrus Club dinner
in Denver, I haven't wanted to let it get away
from me."</p>

<p>"How odd he is," said Lady Alice a moment
later to her father, Toppleton having gone to
his room. "Are you sure he is not an impostor?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," returned Barncastle with a
strange smile; "but I know he is not a thief.
I fancy he is amusing, and I believe he will be
a valuable acquisition to my circle of acquaintances.
Have you heard from the Duchess of
Bangletop?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she will be here. I told her you had a
real American this time&mdash;not an imitation Englishman&mdash;a
poet, and, as far as we could judge,
a character who would surely become a worthy
addition to her collection of oddities; a match,
in fact, for her German worshipper of Napoleon
and that other strange freak of nature she had
at her last reception, the young Illinois widow
who whistled the score of Parsifal."</p>

<p>"The duchess must have been pleased," said
Barncastle with a laugh. "This Toppleton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
will prove a perfect godsend to her, for she has
absolutely nothing that is <i>bizarre</i> for her next
reception."</p>

<p>Toppleton, upstairs in a magnificently appointed
chamber, from the windows of which
were to be seen the most superb distances that
he had ever imagined, was a prey alternately to
misery and to joy. He felicitated himself upon
the apparent success of his plan, while bemoaning
his unhappy lot in having to keep his true
self under in a society he felt himself capable of
adorning, and to enter which he had always
aspired.</p>

<p>"It's too late to back out now, though," he
said. "If I were to strike my colours at this
stage of the battle, I should deserve to be put
in a cask and thrown into the Barbundle yonder.
When I look about me and see all these
magnificent acres, when I observe the sumptuous
furnishing of this superb mansion, when
I see unequalled treasures of art scattered in
profusion about this castle, and then think of
that poor devil of a Chatford roaming about
the world without a piece of bric-a-brac to his
name, or an acre, or a house, or bed, or chair,
or table, of any kind, without even a body, it
makes me mad. Here his body, the inferior
part of man, the purely mortal section of his
being, is living in affluence, while his immortal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
soul is a very tramp, an outcast, a wanderer on
the face of the earth. Barncastle, Barncastle,
you are indeed a villain of the deepest&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Toppleton paused, and looked apprehensively
about him. He seemed to be conscious
of an eye resting upon him. A chill
seized upon his heart, and his breath came short
and quick as it had done but once before when
his invisible client first betrayed his presence in
No. 17.</p>

<p>"I wonder if this is one of those beastly
castles with secret doors in the wainscot and
peep-holes in the pictures," he said nervously
to himself. "It would be just like Barncastle
to have that sort of a house, and of course
nothing would please him better than to try a
haunted chamber on me. The conjunction of a
ghost and a Rocky Mountain poet would be
great, but after my experience with Chatford,
I don't believe there is a ghost in all creation
that could frighten me. Nevertheless, I don't
like being gazed at by an unseen eye. I'll have
to investigate."</p>

<p>Then Toppleton investigated. He mounted
chairs and tables to gaze into the stolid, unresponsive
oil-painted faces of somebody's
ancestry, he knew not whose. Not Barncastle's,
he was sure, for Barncastle was an upstart.
Nothing wrong could be found there. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
eyes were absolutely proof against peeping
Toms. Then he rolled the heavy bureau and
several antique chests away from the massive
oak wainscoting that ran about the room, eight
feet in height and superbly carved. He tapped
every panel with his knuckles, and found them
all solid as a rock.</p>

<p>"No secret door in that," he said; and then
for a second time he experienced that nervous
sensation which comes to him who feels that
he is watched, and as the sensation grew more
and more intense and terrifying, an idea flashed
across Toppleton's mind which heightened his
anxiety.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he said; "I wonder if I am
going mad. Can it be that Chatford is an
illusion, a fanciful creation of a weak mind?
Am I become a prey to hallucinations, and if
so, am I not in grave danger of my personal
liberty here if Barncastle should discover my
weakness?"</p>

<p>It was rather strange, indeed, that this had
not occurred to Hopkins before. It was the
natural explanation of his curious experience,
and the sudden thought that he had foolishly
lent himself to the impulses of a phantasm, and
was carrying on a campaign of destruction
against one of the world's most illustrious men,
based solely upon a figment of a diseased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
imagination, was prostrating. He staggered to
the side of a large tapestried easy-chair, and
limp with fear, toppled over its broad arm into
its capacious depths an almost nerveless mass
of flesh and bones. He would have given worlds
to be back in the land of the midnight sun, in
New York, in London, anywhere but here in
the house of Barncastle of Burningford, and he
resolved then and there that he would return
to London the first thing in the morning, place
himself in the hands of a competent physician,
and trifle with the creations of his fancy no
more.</p>

<p>A prey to these disquieting reflections,
Toppleton lay in the chair for at least an hour.
The last rays of a setting sun trembled through
the leaves of the tree that shaded the western
side of the room, and darkness fell over all;
and with the darkness there came into
Toppleton's life an experience that scattered
his fears of a moment since to the winds, and
so tried and exercised his courage, that that
fast fading quality gained a renewed strength
for the fearful battle with a supernatural foe, in
which he had, out of his goodness of heart,
undertaken to engage.</p>

<p>A clock in the hall outside began to strike
the hour of six in deep measured tones, that to
Toppleton in his agitated state of mind was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
uncomfortably suggestive of the bell in
Coleridge's line that "Knells us back to a
world of death." At the last stroke of the
hammer the tone seemed to become discordant,
and in a frenzy of nervous despair Toppleton
opened his eyes and sprang to his feet. As he
did so, his whole being became palpitant with
terror, for staring at him out of the darkness he
perceived a small orb-like something whose hue
was that of an emerald in combustion. He
clapped his hands over his eyes for a moment,
but that phosphorescent gleam penetrated them,
and then he perceived that it was not an eye
that rested upon him, but a ray of light shining
through a small hole that had escaped his
searching glance in the wainscoting. The
relief of this discovery was so great that it gave
him courage to investigate, and stepping lightly
across the room, noiseless as a particle of dust,
he climbed upon a chair and peeped through
the aperture, though it nearly blinded him to do
so. To shade his eyes from the blinding light,
he again covered them with his hand, and again
observed that its intensity was sufficient to
pierce through the obstruction and dazzle his
vision. The hand so softened the light, however,
that he could see what there was on the
other side of the wall, though it was far from
being a pretty sight that met his gaze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>What he saw was a small oblong room in
which there was no window, and, at first glance,
no means of entrance or exit. It was high-ceiled
like the room in which he stood, and,
with the exception of a narrow couch covered
with a black velvet robe, with a small pillow of
the same material at the far end, the room was
bare of furniture. There was no fire, no fixture
of any kind, lamp or otherwise, from which
illumination could come, and yet the room was
brilliant with that same green light that Chatford
had described to Hopkins at his office in the
Temple. So dazzling was it, that for a moment
Hopkins had difficulty in ascertaining just
what there was in the apartment, but as he
looked he became conscious of forms which
grew more and more distinct as his eye accustomed
itself to the light. On the couch in a
moment appeared, rigid as in death, the body
of Barncastle; the eyes lustreless and staring,
the hands characterless and bluish even in the
green light, the cheeks sunken and the massive
forehead white and cold as marble. The sight
chilled Toppleton to the marrow, and he averted
his eyes from the horrible spectacle only to see
one even more dreadful, for on the other side of
the apartment, grinning fiendishly, the source of
the wonderful light that flooded the room, he
now perceived the fiend, making ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
assume once more the habiliments of mortality.
He was stirring a potion, and, as Hopkins
watched him, he began to whistle a combination
of discords that went through Toppleton's
ears like a knife.</p>

<p>The watcher became sick at heart. This
was the frightful thing he had to cope with!
So frightful was it that he tried to remove his
eye from the peep-hole, and seek again the easy
chair, when to his horror he found that he
could not move. If his eye had in reality been
glued to the aperture, he would not have found
it more firmly fixed than it was at present. As
he struggled to get away from the vision that
was every moment being burned more and
more indelibly into his mind, the fiend's
fearful mirth increased, at the close of one of
the paroxysms of which he lifted the cup in
which the potion had been mixed to his lips,
and quaffed its contents to the very dregs. As
the last drop trickled down the fiend's throat,
Hopkins was startled further to see the light
growing dim, and then he noticed that the
fiend was rapidly decreasing in size, shrinking
slowly from a huge spectral presence into a
hardly visible ball of green fire which rolled
across the apartment to where the body lay;
up the side of the couch to the pillow; along
the pillow to that marble white forehead, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
it paused. A tremor passed through the
human frame lying prostrate there, and in a
moment all was dark as night. The ball of
fire had disappeared through the forehead, and
a deep groan told Toppleton that the body of
Barncastle was once more a living thing having
the semblance of humanity. A moment later
another light appeared in the apartment into
which Toppleton still found himself compelled
to gaze. This time the light was more
natural, for it was the soft genial light of a lamp
shining through a sliding panel at the other
end of the room, through which the Lord of
Burningford passed. It lasted but a moment,
for as the defendant in this fearful case of
Chatford <i>v.</i> Burningford passed into the room
beyond, the slide flew back and all was black
once more.</p>

<p>With the departure of Barncastle, Toppleton
was able to withdraw from his uncomfortable
position, and in less than a moment lay gasping
in his chair.</p>

<p>"It is too real!" he moaned to himself.
"Chatford did not deceive me. I am not the
victim of hallucination. Alas! I wish I
were."</p>

<p>A knock at the door put an end to his
soliloquizing, and he was relieved to hear it.
Here was something earthly at last. He flew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
from his chair across the room through the
darkness to the door and threw it wide open.</p>

<p>"Come in," he cried, and Barncastle himself,
still pale from the effects of the ordeal he had
passed through, entered the room.</p>

<p>"I have come to see if there is anything I
can do for you," he said pleasantly, touching
an electric button which dissipated the darkness
of the room by lighting a hundred lamps.
"The Duchess of Bangletop has arrived and
is anxious to meet you; but you look worn,
Toppleton. You are not ill, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No," stammered Toppleton, slightly overcome
by Barncastle's coolness and affability,
"but I&mdash;I've been taking a nap and I've had
the&mdash;the most horrible dream I ever had."</p>

<p>"Which was?"</p>

<p>"That I&mdash;ah&mdash;why, that I was writing an
obituary poem on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me?" queried Barncastle, calmly.</p>

<p>"No," said Toppleton. "On myself."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DINNER AND ITS RESULT.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A half-hour</span> later Toppleton entered the
drawing room of Barncastle Hall, umbrella in
one hand, carpet-bag in the other; his red
necktie arranged grotesquely about his neck,
the picture of Americanism "as she is drawn"
by British cartoonists. Any other than a well-bred
English gathering would have received him
with hilarious enthusiasm, and Hopkins was
rather staggered as he passed through the doorway
to note the evident interest, and yet utter
lack of surprise, which his appearance inspired
in those who had been bidden to the feast to
meet him. He perceived at once that he no
more than fulfilled the expectations of these
highly cultivated people, and it was with difficulty
that he repressed the mirth which was
madly endeavouring to take possession of his
whole system.</div>

<p>The only portions of his make-up that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
attracted special attention&mdash;if he could judge
from a whispered comment or two that reached
his ears, and the glances directed toward them
by the Duchess of Bangletop and the daughters
of the Earl of Whiskerberry&mdash;were the carpet-bag
and the umbrella. The blue dress coat and
tight-fitting trousers were taken as a matter of
course. The red necktie and diamond stud
were assumed to be the proper thing in Rocky
Mountain society, but the bag and umbrella
seemed to strike the English mind as a case of
Ossa piled upon Pelion.</p>

<p>"Good evening, ladies," said Hopkins with a
bow which was graceful in spite of his efforts to
make it awkward. "I hope I haven't increased
anybody's appetite uncomfortably by being
late. This watch of mine is set to Rocky
Mountain time, and it's a little unreliable in
this climate."</p>

<p>"He's just the dear delightful creature I have
been looking for for years and years," said the
Duchess of Bangletop to Lady Maude Whiskerberry.</p>

<p>"So very American," said Lady Cholmondely
Persimmon, of Persimmon Towers&mdash;a well-preserved
young noblewoman of eighteen or
twenty social seasons.</p>

<p>"Duchess," said Barncastle, coming forward,
"permit me to present to you my friend Hopkins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Parkerberry Toppleton, the Poet Laureate
of the Rocky Mountains."</p>

<p>"Howdy do, Duchess," said Toppleton, dropping
his carpet-bag, and extending his hand to
grasp that of the Duchess.</p>

<p>"So pleased," said the Duchess with a smile
and an attempt at hauteur, which was hardly
successful.</p>

<p>"Glad you're pleased," said Toppleton,
"because that means we're both pleased."</p>

<p>"Lady Maude Whiskerberry, Mr. Toppleton.
Lady Persimmon, Mr. Toppleton," said Barncastle,
resuming the introductions after Toppleton
had picked up the carpet-bag again and
announced his readiness to meet the other
ladies.</p>

<p>In a very short time Toppleton had been
made acquainted with all in the room, and inasmuch
as he seemed so taken with the Duchess
of Bangletop, Lady Alice, who was a young
woman of infinite tact, and not too rigidly
bound by conventionality, relinquished her
claim to the guest of the evening, and when
dinner was announced, permitted Toppleton to
escort the Duchess into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, my dear Mr. Toppleton,"
said the Duchess as the American offered her his
arm, "don't you think you might&mdash;ah&mdash;leave
your luggage here? It's rather awkward to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
carry an umbrella, a carpet-bag, and a Duchess
into dinner all at once."</p>

<p>"Nothing is too awkward for an American,
Duchess," said Toppleton. "Besides," he
added in a stage whisper, "I don't dare leave
these things out of my sight. Barncastle's
butler looks all right, but I've lived in a country
where confidence in your fellow-men is a heaven-born
gift. I wasn't born with it, and there
hasn't any of it been sent down since."</p>

<p>"Aren't you droll!" said the Duchess.</p>

<p>"If you say it I'll bet on it," said Toppleton,
gallantly, as they entered the beautiful dining-room
and took their allotted chairs, when Hopkins
perceived, much to his delight, that
Barncastle was almost the length of the table
distant; that on one side of him was Lady
Alice, and on the other the Duchess of Bangletop.</p>

<p>"These two women are both an inspiration in
their way," he said to himself. "Lady Alice,
even if she loves that monster of a father of
hers, ought to be rescued from him. She will
inspire me with courage, and this portly
Duchess will help me to be outrageous enough
in my deportment to satisfy the thirst of the
most rabidly uninformed Englishman at the
board for American unconventionality."</p>

<p>"Have you been in this country long?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the Duchess, as Toppleton slid his umbrella and
carpet-bag under his chair, and prepared to sit
down.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a time," said Toppleton. "Ten
days."</p>

<p>"Indeed. As long as that?" said the
Duchess. "You must have seen a great deal of
England in that time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Hopkins. "I went out
to see Shakespeare's house and his grave and
all that. That's enough to last a lifetime; but
it seems to me, Lord Barncastle, you don't
give Shakespeare the mausoleum he ought to
have. Out in the Rockies we'd have had a pile
set up over him so high that you could sit on
top of it and talk with St. Peter without lifting
your voice."</p>

<p>"You are an admirer of Shakespeare, then,
Mr. Toppleton?" said Barncastle with a look
of undisguised admiration at Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Am I? Me? Well, I just guess I am,"
replied Toppleton. "If it hadn't been for
William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon,
you'd never have heard of Hopkins P. Toppleton,
of Blue-bird Gulch."</p>

<p>"How poetic! Blue-bird Gulch," simpered
Lady Persimmon.</p>

<p>"He was your inspiration, Mr. Toppleton?"
suggested Lady Alice with a gracious smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what he was," said Toppleton. "I
might say he's my library. There's three
volumes in my library all told. One's a fine
thick book containing the total works of the
bard of Avon; another is a complete concordance
of the works of the same author; and
the third is the complete works of Hopkins
Parkerberry Toppleton, consisting of eighty-three
poems, a table of contents, and a portrait
in three colours of the author. I'd be glad to
give you all a copy, ladies, but it's circulated by
subscription only."</p>

<p>"I should so like to see the book," said Lady
Maude Whiskerberry.</p>

<p>"I'd be mighty proud to show it to you,"
said Toppleton, "and if you and your father
here, the earl, ever pass my way out there in
the Rockies, just look me up and you shall see
it. But Shakespeare was my guiding genius,
Duchess. When I began to get those tired
feelings that show a man he's either a poet or
a victim to malaria, I began to look about and
see who I'd better take as a model. I dawdled
around for a year, reading some of Milton's
things, but they didn't take me under the
eighth rib, which with me is the rib of appreciation,
so I bought a book called 'Household
Poetry,' and I made up my mind that Shakespeare,
taking him altogether, was my poet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
He was a little old-fangled in some things, but
in the main he seemed to strike home, and I
sent word to our bookseller to get me everything
he wrote, and to count on me to take
anything new of his that happened to be coming
out."</p>

<p>"Not a costly matter that!" said the Earl
of Whiskerberry with the suggestion of a sneer.
He did not quite approve of this original.</p>

<p>"No, my dear Earl," replied Toppleton.
"For you know Shakespeare is dead&mdash;though
I didn't know it at the time, either. But I got
the book, and I tell you it made a new man of
me. 'Here' I said, 'is my model. I'll be like
him, and if I succeed, H. P. T.'s name will
be known for miles around.' And it was so.
It was not a year before I had a poem
of 600 lines printed in our county paper, and
there wasn't a word in it that wasn't Shakespearean.
I took good care of that, for
when I had the poem written, I bought the
concordance, and when I found that I had
used a word that was not in the concordance, I
took it out and used another that was."</p>

<p>"That's a very original idea, and, I think, a
good one," said Lady Alice. "You are absolutely
sure of your English if you do that; but
wasn't it laborious, Mr. Toppleton?"</p>

<p>"It was at first, miss, but as I went along,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and began to use words over again it got easier
and easier, and for the last fifteen pages of the
poem I hardly had to look up on an average
more than six words to a page."</p>

<p>"But poetry," put in Barncastle, half closing
his eyes and gazing steadfastly at Hopkins as
he did so, "poetry is more than verbiage. Did
you become a student of nature?"</p>

<p>As Barncastle spoke, Toppleton's nerve
weakened slightly, for it was the very question
he had desired to have asked. It brought him
to the point where his winning stroke was
possible, and to feel that he was on the verge
of the struggle was somewhat disquieting.
His uneasiness was short-lived, for in a moment
when he realized how eminently successful had
been his every step so far, how everything had
transpired even as he had foreseen it would, he
gained confidence in himself and in his course.</p>

<p>"I did, Barncastle; particularly a student of
human nature. I studied man. I endeavoured
to learn what quality in man it was that made
him great and what quality made him weak. I
became an expert in a great many osophies and
ologies that had never been heard of in the
Rocky Mountains before," answered Toppleton,
forgetting his assumed character under the
excitement of the moment and speaking, flushed
of face, with more vehemence than the occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
seemed to warrant. "And I venture to
assert, sir, that there is no physiognomy in all
creation that I cannot read, save possibly
yours which baffles me. I read much in your
face that I would rather not see there."</p>

<p>Barncastle flushed. The ladies toyed nervously
with their fans. Lady Alice appeared
slightly perturbed, and Hopkins grew pale. The
Duchess of Bangletop alone was unmoved.
Toppleton's heat was hardly what was expected
on an occasion of this sort, but the duchess had
made up her mind not to marvel at anything
the guest of the evening might do, and she
regarded his vehemence as quite pardonable
inasmuch as it must be characteristic of an unadulterated
Americanism.</p>

<p>"Fancy!" she said. "Do you mean to say,
Mr. Toppleton, that you can tell by a face what
sort of a life one has led; what his or her
character has been, is, and is to be?"</p>

<p>"I do, Duchess," returned Toppleton.
"Though for your comfort as well as for that
of others at this table, let me add that I invariably
keep what I see religiously to myself."</p>

<p>The humour of this rejoinder and the
laughter which followed it cleared the atmosphere
somewhat, but from the gravity of his
host and the tense way in which Barncastle's
eye was fastened upon him, Hopkins knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that his shaft as to the baffling qualities of
Barncastle's face had struck home.</p>

<p>"You interest me," said the Earl, when the
mirth of his guests had subsided. "I too
have studied physiognomy, but I never
observed that there was anything baffling
about my own. I am really quite interested
to know why you find it so."</p>

<p>"Because," said Toppleton nervously yet
firmly, "because your face is not consistent
with your record. Because you have achieved
more than one could possibly read in or
predict from your face."</p>

<p>"I always said that myself, Barncastle," said
the duchess airily. "I've always said you
didn't look like a great man."</p>

<p>"While acknowledging, Duchess, that I
nevertheless am?" queried Barncastle with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, moderately so, Barncastle, moderately
so. Fact is," said the Duchess, "you
can stir a multitude with your eloquence; you
can write a novel that so will absorb a school-girl
that she can't take her eyes from its early
pages to look into the back of the book and see
how it is all going to turn out; you can talk a
hostile parliament into doing violence to its
secret convictions; but in some respects you
are wanting. You are an atrocious horse-back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
rider, you never take a run with the hounds,
and I must say I have seen times when you
seemed to me to be literally too big for yourself."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" thought Toppleton. "What a
clever fellow I am! If this duchess is so competent
a reader of character as her estimate of
Barncastle shows her to be, it's a marvel she
hasn't found me out."</p>

<p>Barncastle laughed with a seeming heartiness
at the duchess's remark, though to Toppleton,
who was now watching him closely, he paled
slightly.</p>

<p>"One of us is more than he expected, and
two of us simply shock him," said Hopkins to
himself.</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Toppleton," said Barncastle,
"in view of my perfect willingness to
have you do so, you can have no hesitation in
telling me what you read in my face. Eh?"</p>

<p>"I have not," said Toppleton, gulping down
a glass of wine to gain a little time as well as
to stimulate his nerves. He had not expected
to be so boldly met by his host. "I have not;
but truly, my dear Barncastle, I'd rather not,
for it's a mighty poor verdict that the lines of
your face return for you, and inasmuch as that
verdict is utterly opposed to your record, it
seems hardly worth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell it us, Mr. Toppleton," put in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Lady Alice. "It will be the more interesting
coming from one who has so admired my
father that he has travelled <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thousand'">thousands</ins> of miles
to see him. Do go on."</p>

<p>Hopkins blushed, hesitated a minute and
then began.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "let it be as you say.
My lord," he added, looking Barncastle straight
in the eye, "if I were to judge you by the
lines of your face, I should say that your
character was essentially a weak one. That
you possessed no single attribute of greatness.
That your whole life was given over to an almost
criminal tendency to avoid responsibility; to
be found wanting at crises; to a desire, almost
a genius I might say, for meeting your troubles
in a half-hearted, compromising spirit which
should have resulted in placing you in the
ranks of the mediocre. The lines of your head
are singularly slight for one of your years.
There is hardly a furrow on your brow; on
the contrary your flesh is so tightly drawn over
your skull, that it would seem to suggest the
presence in that skull of a brain too far developed
for its prison; in other words your brain
is as badly accommodated by your skull, I
should judge, as a man of majestic proportions
would be in the best Sunday suit of a little
Lord Fauntleroy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are giving me a fine idea of my personal
appearance, my dear Toppleton," said
Lord Barncastle, pouring a tablespoonful of
wine into a small glass into which, if his
guests had been watching his hands closely,
they might have seen him place a small white
powder.</p>

<p>"The strange part of it is that it is true,
Barncastle," said the duchess. "I've thought
pretty much the same thing many a time."</p>

<p>"Anything more, Toppleton?" queried
Barncastle.</p>

<p>"Yes, one thing, my lord," said Hopkins,
nerving himself up to the final stroke. "The
eyes, one of our American poets has said, are
the windows of the soul. Now if I were to look
into your eyes at your soul, I'd say to myself,
'Hopkins, my boy, there's an old man living in
a new house,' for I'll take my oath that <i>I</i> see
the soul of a centenarian, Lord Barncastle, in
the body of a man of sixty every time I look
into your eyes."</p>

<p>Toppleton's bold words had hardly passed his
lips when Lady Alice, who was becoming very
uncomfortable because of the personal trend
of the conversation, rose from her chair and
gave the signal for the ladies to depart into the
drawing-room, leaving Barncastle and his
guests over their coffee and cigars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"What an extraordinary gift that is of
yours!" the Earl of Whiskerberry said to Toppleton
as Barncastle walked with the duchess
as far as the drawing-room door. "D'ye know,
my deah sir, it's truly appalling to think you
can do it, you know, because there's so much
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The earl's sentence was never finished, for a
heavy fall interrupted him at this point, and
Toppleton, turning to see whence it came, was
horrified and yet not altogether displeased to
see prostrate on the rug, white and lifeless as it
had been in the room on the other side of the
wainscoting upstairs two hours before, the
body of Barncastle of Burningford.</p>

<p>"Frightened him out at the very first shot!"
said Toppleton gleefully to himself. "He is
easier game than I thought."</p>

<p>"I believe the man is dead!" said the earl,
anxiously putting his hand over Barncastle's
heart, and standing appalled to find that it had
stopped beating.</p>

<p>"No," said Toppleton, with an effort at
calmness, "this is a case of trance only&mdash;suspended
animation. He will revive in a very
short time, I fancy. This sort of thing is common
among men of his peculiar character; I've
seen it happen dozens of times. Have him
carried to his room; tell Lady Alice that at my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
request he has started out to show me the Barbundle
in the moonlight&mdash;in fact, say anything
about me you please, only get up a plausible pretext
for Barncastle's absence. I do not think
his daughter knows he has these attacks, and
there is no reason why she should know, because
they are not dangerous."</p>

<p>With this the earl repaired to the drawing-room,
where he made the excuses for Hopkins
and Lord Barncastle. Toppleton and the
butler carried the prostrate Barncastle up to
his room, and then the American, utterly worn
out with excitement, entered his own apartments
to await developments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BARNCASTLE CONFIDES IN HOPKINS.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Toppleton</span> had not long to wait. His nerves
had hardly resumed their normal condition
when he heard a tottering step in the hall outside,
followed by a soft tapping at the door.</div>

<p>"Who's there?" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is I, Toppleton&mdash;Barncastle. Let me in
and be quick. I have something very important
to say to you."</p>

<p>Hopkins ran to the door and opened it, and
Barncastle entered, his face pale and his general
aspect that of a man who had passed through
a terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I've landed my man!" said
Toppleton to himself. Then he added aloud,
"My dear Barncastle, you don't know what a
turn you gave me downstairs. I sincerely hope
you are not ill?"</p>

<p>"I am ill, Toppleton; ill almost unto death,
and it is you who have made me so."</p>

<p>"I?" cried Hopkins, with well-feigned surprise.
"I don't quite catch your drift."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your accursed faculty for reading character
in the face, and searching out the soul of
man in the depths of his eyes has made you
the only man I have ever feared. We must
come to some understanding in this matter.
I want to know what your object is in coming
here to expose me before my friends, to lay
bare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Object? What is my object?" returned
Hopkins, with capital dissemblance. "Why,
my dear fellow, what object could I have? I
read your face and searched your eyes for indications
of your character at your own request,
and with your permission made known what I
saw there&mdash;for it is there, Barncastle, plain as
any material object in this room."</p>

<p>"It is dreadful! dreadful!" said Barncastle,
covering his eyes with his hands and
quivering with emotion and fear. "I had no
idea your power was so great. Do you suppose
for an instant that had I known how unerringly
accurate you are as a reader of mind and face,
that I would ever have asked you to lay bare to
those people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me, Barncastle," said Toppleton,
rising and putting his hand on the other's
shoulder in a caressing manner, "really you
ought to lie down and rest. This thing will all
pass off with a night's sleep. You&mdash;you don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
seem to be quite yourself to-night. You
mustn't mind what I have said."</p>

<p>"You do not know, Toppleton, you do not
know. You have done that to-night which has
shown me that a dreadful secret which I have
carried locked in my breast for thirty years,
is as easily to be wrested from me by you as my
jewels by a house-breaker."</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow," said Toppleton, his
spirit growing with pride at his success in
bringing down his game with so little effort,
"I&mdash;I understand that this is only one of the
exceptions to the rules which govern the mind-reader's
art. I do not really believe, of course,
that what I seem to see beneath the surface is
actually there. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not try to deceive me, Mr. Toppleton,"
sobbed Barncastle. "I, too, am something of
a reader of character, as I told you, and I know
exactly what you believe and what you do not
believe. Had I been in such a position at
dinner as would have permitted me to look as
deeply into your eyes as you looked into mine,
I should not have asked you to divulge what
you saw. In fact, Toppleton, as you have
probably seen for yourself, I have all along
under-estimated your abilities, which do not, I
confess, show up as advantageously as they
might. You Americans are a cleverer people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
than you appear to be, and you have a faculty
of dissemblance that is baffling to us in the
older world, who have acquired candour through
our conceit. We are so conscious of our
superiority and ultimate ability to gain the
upper hand in all that we undertake, that we
do not consider it necessary to cloak our real
feelings. The whole world speaks of the Briton's
brutal frankness, and speaks justly. We are
candid often against our best interests. We
are impulsively frank where you Americans are
diplomatically reserved. It is this trait in my
people that makes it difficult for our Government
to find suitable diplomats to fill the various
foreign missions that must be filled, while your
Government finds it difficult to find missions
for all the diplomats who must be provided for.
We have to train our Ministers and Ambassadors
in the hard school of experience, as <i>attach&eacute;s</i> to
legations, while you have only to go to your
newspaper offices, to your great political organizations,
or to your flourishing business concerns
to find all the Envoys Extraordinary you
need with a comfortable reserve force standing
always ready to step into any shoes that death,
advancement, or revulsion of popular sentiment
may make vacant. You are a great people;
greater far than you seem on the surface, and
it is this fact, unheeded by me who should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
known better, that deceived me. I judged you
from the standpoint of your exterior; I saw
that you were a character, but beyond the green
umbrella and carpet-bag indications I failed to
look, and I thought I might safely venture the
act which has come so nearly to my undoing.
I see you now as you are. I apologize for
underrating your ability, and I say to you
frankly, that I rejoice all the more greatly in
your proffered friendship since I have come to
see that it is an honour not lightly to be worn."</p>

<p>"My dear Barncastle," ejaculated Hopkins,
breathless with wonder and pride. "I assure
you that your words overwhelm me. Your
kind heart, I fear, has led you into over-estimating
my poor character as much as you
claim to have under-estimated it. I am by no
means all that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Toppleton!" said Barncastle, "let us
not waste words. I know you as you are at
last, and you need cloak your real self from me
no more. I feared for an instant that you
might be my enemy, though why you should be
I do not know, and to have you read my secret
as though it were printed upon an open page
before you, filled my soul with terror. You
have found me out, but you do not and you
cannot know what has brought me to this unless
I tell you, and I must insist that you become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
acquainted with my story, that you may the
better judge of my innocence in the matter.
When I have told you this story, I wish to exact
from you a promise never to reveal it, for once
revealed it would be my ruin."</p>

<p>"I do not wish, my dear Barncastle," said
Toppleton, burning with anxiety to hear the
other's story, and yet desirous of appearing unconcerned
in order that Barncastle might throw
himself unreservedly in his hands. "I have no
desire to pry into another man's secrets, to
wrest unwilling confidences from any man. If
I have discovered one of your secrets, I have
done so unwittingly, and I do not wish you to
feel that I am holding you up, to use one of our
Western expressions, for confidences. Keep
your secret if it is one you wish to hold inviolate.
I shall never tell what I have seen or what you
have said to me."</p>

<p>"You are a generous, high-minded person,
Toppleton. A poet at soul and a gentleman as
well; but you must hear my story, for it is my
justification in your eyes, and that is as necessary
to my happiness, now that I know you for the
man you are, as justification in the eyes of the
world would become were the world to suspect
what you have seen. I did not mind any
portion of what you said at the table to-night,
Toppleton, until you delivered yourself of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
opinion that the soul of a man of a hundred and
more years was dwelling in this body of mine, a
body many years younger. Mr. Toppleton, I do
not want you to think me mad. I want you to
believe me when I say that what you saw is
absolutely a fact. My soul has lived precisely
one hundred and twenty-six years, my body
sixty-one!"</p>

<p>Toppleton's expression of surprise as Barncastle
spoke would have done credit to a
tragedian of the highest rank.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Barncastle," he said, kindly.
"I really think you'd better let me send for
Lady Alice and have the family physician summoned.
Your mind is somewhat affected."</p>

<p>"Come with me," said Barncastle, rising
from his chair and leading Toppleton out
through the door into and along the hallway
until they reached his private apartment. "I
want you on entering this room to swear never
to divulge what you shall see within, for I shall
prove the truth of my assertion respecting my
soul before you leave it, and, Toppleton, the
maintenance of my secret is a matter of life and
death to me."</p>

<p>"Of course, my lord, I shall not tell anyone
of this interview except for your good. It is
truly painful to me, for in spite of your apparent
clearness of head I cannot help feeling that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
excitement of this evening, together with the
responsibilities a man of your position must
necessarily assume, have made you feverish and
slightly delirious."</p>

<p>"I shall dispel all such ideas as that," said
Barncastle, opening the door and ushering
Hopkins into his room. "Pray be seated," he
said, "and do not leave your seat until I request
you to."</p>

<p>"I hear and obey," quoted Toppleton, his
mind reverting to the Arabian Tales, the splendour
of his surroundings and the generally uncanny
quality of his experience reminding him
forcibly of the land of the Genii.</p>

<p>"I am going to prove to you now," said
Barncastle, "that what I have said about my
soul is true. Excuse me for being absent from
the room for just five minutes, and also pardon
me if I extinguish the light here. Darkness is
necessary to convince you that what I say is
truth; and, above all, Toppleton, look to your
nerves."</p>

<p>Barncastle suited his action to his words.
He extinguished the light and disappeared. In
five minutes, during which time Hopkins sat in
the inky darkness alone trying to formulate a
plan for future action, a panel in the wainscot
was moved softly to one side and Toppleton
found himself face to face with the fiend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment he was numb with fear, but
when the green shadow moved toward him and
spoke in soft insinuating tones and appeared to
fear him quite as much as he feared it, his
courage returned.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is this?" he cried, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>"I am the soul of Barncastle. Barncastle
lies prostrate as in death in the den beyond the
wall. I am also the soul of Horace Calderwood
who died forty-five years ago at the age of
eighty, whose body lies buried in the yard of
Monckton Chapel, at Kennelly Manor, Kent."</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of it&mdash;how&mdash;how has
it come that you&mdash;that you are here?" cried
Hopkins, with well-feigned terror. "What
awful power have you that you can leave your
body and appear as you do now?"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Toppleton. There is no
awful power about it," said the fiend. "It
is a simple enough matter when you understand
it. I am simply an immortal soul with
mortal cravings. I love this world. It delights
me to live in this sphere, and it is given to the
soul to return here if it sees fit. That is what
makes heaven heaven. The soul is free to do
whatsoever it wills."</p>

<p>"But how is it," said Toppleton, "that this
has never happened before?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has happened before. It is happening
all the time, only you mortals never find it out.
You want instances? The soul of Macchiavelli
returned to earth and entered the body of a
Jew; result, Beaconsfield. The soul of C&aelig;sar
returned to earth and entered the body of a
puny Corsican; result, Bonaparte. The soul
of Horace returned to earth and entered the
body of an English boy; therefore, Thackeray.
The soul of Diogenes returned to earth and entered
the body of another English boy; result,
Thomas Carlyle. Six souls, those of Terence,
Plato, &AElig;sculapius, Cicero, C&aelig;sar, Chaucer,
combined and, returning to earth, took possession
of the body of a wayward child of Warwickshire;
whence, Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"And the real souls of these men?" cried
Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Became a part of space, and still so remain.
How else account for the evolution of genius?
Did you ever know a genius in his infancy?"</p>

<p>"No; I can't say that I ever did," said
Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Well, with very rare exceptions geniuses are
the stupidest of babies, or, supposing that in
youth they give great promise, the valedictorian
of his college class ends his life oftener than not
without distinction, a third-rate lawyer, perhaps
a poor doctor, a prosy clergyman, or as Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Somebody's husband. The man who is graduated
at the foot of his class has oftener won the
laurels than he. How is it accounted for?
How did Keats, son of a stableman, become the
sweetest of our sonneteers? In your own
country, how did Lincoln and Grant spring
from nothing to greatness? Was the germ of
greatness discoverable in them in their youth?
Would the most reckless of prophets have dared
assert that the heavy tanner's boy would become
the immortal hero of the Wilderness, the saviour
of the Republic, the uncrowned ruler of fifty
millions of people even with a thousand years
of life to live? I tell you, Toppleton, the
mystery of this life is more mysterious than
you think. There are things happening every
minute of the day, every second of the minute,
the knowledge of which would drive a mortal
mind&mdash;that is, a mind which has never put on
immortality by passing into the other world&mdash;to
despair."</p>

<p>"But, Barncastle," said Hopkins, his knees
growing weak and his blood running cold, this
time in actual terror, "how comes it that I, a
mortal, inspire you, an immortal, with fear,
as you claim I have done?"</p>

<p>"There is a point beyond which an immortal
mind cannot with safety indulge in mortal
habiliments. Have you never observed how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
men of genius outlive their genius? Did
Bonaparte die at the height of his glory? Did
Grant die at the zenith of his power?"</p>

<p>"D'Israeli did."</p>

<p>"D'Israeli embodied Macchiavelli, and Macchiavelli
made no mistakes. I have made a
mistake. I have lived too long as Barncastle,
and every day beyond the day on which I
should have left this body has lessened my
greatness, my power, until I am become as
weak as though I had never put on immortality.
It is my craving to be among men, that has
been my weakening, if not my ruin. The love
of contact with mankind is as strong with me
as is the love of drink with others. I cannot
give it up."</p>

<p>"And the poor soul whose place you took?"
said Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of him," said the fiend. "I
have made his name a great one. I have
suffered more than he in my efforts to lift his
personality to a plane it would never have
reached had he been left to go his own way, to
occupy his own person. He is my debtor,
Toppleton. I have no feelings of regret for
him. I went to him in a spirit of fairness and
honesty, and offered to make him a famous man.
He declined the offer. I assumed the risk of
compelling him, and after the first compulsion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
he was acquiescent but not candid. When
Horace Calderwood died, and I, his soul, for
the first time learned that it was possible for a
spirit to return to earth and do these things,
the idea of depriving a fellow-soul of material
existence was repellent to me, and seemed not
to be strictly honest. He should enjoy, it
seemed to me, something more than the consciousness
of his greatness. He should be permitted
to taste <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i> the delights
of fame. And I resolved that I would not do
as these others before me had done, and drive
the real spirit of my,&mdash;ah&mdash;well, call him my
victim if you choose&mdash;I resolved that I would
not drive the real spirit of my victim out into
space, leaving him to sigh and bewail his
unhappy estate throughout all eternity. My
plan was to go shares. To assume possession
only so far as was necessary to insure the
winning of the laurel; to let the other return to
his corporeal estate in hours of leisure. I
should have continued of this mind until to-day
had I not had the misfortune to select for
my operations an uncandid person, who had no
genius, save that for tearing down what I was
up-building. It became necessary for me to
exile him for ever to save him from himself.
He had been made a great man, and had I
deserted him he would have become a conspicuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
failure; his name would have been
disgraced in proportion to the greatness it had
had thrust upon it, and the soul of that one
would have lived a life of humiliation and
misery. What I did was the humane thing.
I exiled him from himself, and I have no regrets
for having done so."</p>

<p>"Well, of course," said Toppleton, "you
know more about it than I do, but it seems to
me it's a mighty rough thing to condemn a soul
to perpetual existence on this earth deprived of
the only means which can put him in a position
to enjoy that life. If you are not joking with
me, Barncastle, and your present appearance is
pretty good proof that you are not, it seems to
me that you have been guilty of a wrong,
although your reasons for believing that you
have done right are worthy of consideration. It
strikes me that an omniscient, such as you pretended
to be, ought not to have been bothered
by the lack of candour of a purely finite mind;
and, after all, it was but a bit of superb conceit
on your part to think that you could do things
differently from those who had gone before you."</p>

<p>"But my motive, Toppleton. Credit me
with a proper motive," pleaded the fiend.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Hopkins. "But out in the
Rocky Mountains, my lord, we have lynched
several thieves who stole to keep their families<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from starving. Their motives were all right, but
they were suspended just the same. But let
me ask you one question. To what extent do
you retain that remarkable omniscient quality?
I want to know, for candidly, much as I
admire you, Barncastle, it rather awes me to
think that you can penetrate to the innermost
recesses of my brain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can no longer do that," said Barncastle.
"My power through long confinement to mortal
habitations has materially lessened, as I have
already told you. Do you suppose, my dear
sir, that, were it not so, I should be here, at
this moment, unbosoming myself to you, and
begging you in the name of humanity never to
utter one word of what has passed between us?
Do you think that I, who was once able to
destroy a mortal's reason by one glance of my
eye, would be so overcome by the words of a
mind-reading American poet if I still had the
power to subject his will to mine?"</p>

<p>"No one would believe me were I to tell him
your horrible secret," said Hopkins. "Indeed,
I don't know that I believe it myself. There is,
of course plenty of evidence of which I have
had ocular demonstration, but this may be all
a dream. I may wake up to-morrow and find
myself in my hammock in Blue-bird Gulch."</p>

<p>"No, it is no dream," said the fiend. "It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
all too real, but you will not expose me, Toppleton.
There are those who would believe it,
some who half suspect me even now would gain
re-enforcement in their suspicions. My daughter
would be shocked beyond expression and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That, my lord," said Hopkins "is your convincing
argument. Lady Alice's peace of mind
must be held inviolate, and I shall be dumb;
but I think you might let the exiled spirit enter
once more into bodily life. The allotted days of
the body you have wrested from him must be
growing few in number. Why not atone for
the past by admitting him once more?"</p>

<p>"There are two reasons, Toppleton," said
Barncastle, fixing his eye with great intensity
upon Hopkins, who maintained his composure
with great difficulty. "In the first place, there
are responsibilities which still devolve upon
the Lord of Burningford which he would be
utterly unable to assume. You might assume
them, for you are a clever man. You have the
making of a brilliant man in you, but he has
not, and never will have. He is the most
pusillanimous soul in the universe, and with
him in charge, that body would die in less than
six months. In the second place I have lost
sight of him of late years, or rather lost consciousness
of him, for he has been visible at no
time since he departed from his normal condition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and since the day of my marriage, whose
happiness he made a mad public endeavour to
destroy, I have had no dealings with him.
Where he is now, I have not the slightest idea."</p>

<p>"Well, I know!" ejaculated Toppleton, forgetting
himself and throwing caution to the
winds.</p>

<p>"You know what? Where he is?" returned
the fiend, with a look that restored Toppleton's
senses and showed him that he had made a
mistake.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he replied, his face getting red
with confusion. "Oh, no, not that. You interrupted
me. I was going to say that I know&mdash;er&mdash;I
know how difficult your&mdash;er&mdash;your position
is in the matter, and&mdash;er&mdash;that I hardly
knew what to advise."</p>

<p>"Ah!" returned the fiend, with a smile that
to Toppleton's eyes betokened relief. "You
have taken a load off my mind. Do you know,
my dear fellow, that for one instant I half
believed that you really knew of the original
Chatford's whereabouts, and that perhaps you
were in league with him against me. I see,
however, how unfounded the impression was."</p>

<p>"How could you suspect me of that?" said
Toppleton, reproachfully, his heart beating
wildly at the narrowness of the escape. "But
you don't intend to let him back?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not if I can help myself, Toppleton," said
the fiend. "I shall hang on here as long as I
can, not only for my own sake and for that of my
daughter, but also for the peace of mind of the
exiled soul. You will respect my confidence,
will you not?"</p>

<p>"I shall, Barncastle. You may count on
me," said Toppleton.</p>

<p>"Good. Now I will resume the mortal
habitation for which I have so long been a
trustee, and we can rejoin the ladies."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Barncastle and the Poet
of the Rockies entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy your walk, Mr. Toppleton?"
queried Lady Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess!" returned Toppleton.
"Your father has one of the finest estates I
have ever seen since I left Colorado, and as for
your moon, it fairly out-moons any moon I've
seen in the Rockies in all my life."</p>

<p>"It's the same moon that everybody else
has," said the Duchess of Bangletop with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, Duchess," returned Toppleton, sitting
beside her. "But you've furnished it better
than we have. That Barbundle River gives it a
setting beside which the creek in Blue-bird
Gulch is as a plate-glass window to a sea of
diamonds."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MR. HOPKINS TOPPLETON MAKES A DISCOVERY.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly to be wondered at that Toppleton
did not sleep much that night at Barncastle
Hall. The state of his nerves was not calculated
to permit him to sleep even had he been
willing to do so. The experiences of the day
were not of a nature to give him such confidence
in his surroundings as would have enabled him
to woo rest with a serene sense of safety.
Furthermore, it was his desire to push his
endeavour through to as immediate a conclusion
as was possible, and time was too precious to
waste in rest. Hence it was that the dawning
of another day found him utterly fagged out,
awake, and still meditating upon the means
most likely to crown his efforts with success.</div>

<p>"I am afraid," he said, as he turned the
matter over and over in his mind, "I am afraid
it's going to be a harder task than I thought.
My plan has worked admirably up to a certain
point, but there it has ceased to result as I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
anticipated. He is frightened, that is certain;
but he cannot be frightened into a restitution.
He is too selfish to give up Chatford's body
and take his chances of getting another, and
his rather natural distrust of Chatford's ability
to sustain the greatness of the name of Barncastle
re-enforces his selfishness. I can't
blame him either. I haven't a doubt that
Chatford's spirit would prove too weak to
keep the body going a year at the outside, and
yet it is his, and he ought to have it. He ought
to&mdash;have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here wearied Nature asserted herself, and
Hopkins' head dropped back on the soft cushion
of his couch, and he lost consciousness in a
sleep that knew no dreams.</p>

<p>The morning hours passed away and still he
slept. Afternoon gave place to night, and as
the moon rose over the Barbundle and bathed
the beautiful scene as with silver, Hopkins
opened his eyes again and looked about him.
He was annoyed to find that his vision had in
some manner become slightly obscured; he
seemed to see everything through a faint
suggestion of a haze, and an object ten feet
distant that he remembered admiring as he lay
on his couch the afternoon before, its every
detail clear cut and distinct to the eye, was
now a confused jumble of lines only, suggestive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of nothing in particular, though the moonlight
streaming in through the window shone directly
upon it.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he said, passing his hands over
his eyes as if to sweep away the filmy web that
interfered with his sight. "I seem to have a
slight vertigo, and yet I cannot understand why
I should. I hardly drank anything last night,
and as for what I ate it was simplicity itself.
But I wonder how long I have been asleep;
let me see." Here he consulted his watch, the
great silver timepiece he had brought with him.</p>

<p>"Humph," he said; "half-past seven. I
must have slept nearly thirteen hours; unlucky
number that. No wonder I have vertigo."</p>

<p>He rose from the couch and walked, or
rather tottered, to the window to look out upon
the beautifully serene Barbundle.</p>

<p>"Mercy! How weak I am!" he cried, grasping
the sill for support. "This trouble seems
to have gone to my knees as well. I can hardly
stand, and&mdash;ow&mdash;there is a touch of rheumatism
in my right arm! I shall have to ring for
Parker to bring me a little resolution in the
form of a stiff horn of whiskey. These old
English homes I'm afraid are a little damp."</p>

<p>He touched the bell at the side of the doorway
and staggered back to the couch, falling upon it
in a heap in sheer weakness, and as he did so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
he again became conscious of someone gazing
at him from the other side of the room, and as
he looked, the fiend in his emerald disembodiment
took shape and approached him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Barncastle," said Toppleton, to whom
custom had rendered the fiend's appearance less
terrible. "I am glad to see you. I'm afraid I
am ill. I have the most unaccountable weakness
in my knees. My eyesight seems to have
grown dim, and I am conscious of my head
which is really a new sensation to me. I wish
you'd send your butler up here with some
whiskey."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll send him," returned the fiend
with, or so it seemed to Toppleton, a lack of
friendly interest in his tone which rather
surprised him, for Barncastle had hitherto been
the quintessence of politeness. "I fancy you'll
be better in the morning; and between you and
me I'd let whiskey alone. Brandy and soda is
my drink, and I think it will do you more good
in your present state than whiskey."</p>

<p>"Very well, Barncastle," Hopkins began.</p>

<p>"Don't call me Barncastle," returned the
fiend, impatiently. "Your discovery of my
secret has made all that intolerable to me, and
I intend hereafter to spend as little of my time
in that form as is consistent with propriety. I
did not realize until you came here how long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
confinement within anatomical limits had weakened
my powers, and to find myself at this period
of my existence almost, if not quite, as incompetent
to meet the grave crises of life as any
mortal, is galling in the extreme. Call me anything
you please, but drop Barncastle."</p>

<p>"Very well," again replied Toppleton. "I
will call you my friend Greene."</p>

<p>"Humorous to the last, Toppleton," laughed
the fiend. "That's a truly American characteristic.
I believe you'll jest with your dying
breath."</p>

<p>"Quite likely," said Hopkins, lightly.
"That is if I ever draw it."</p>

<p>"Ah! Have you discovered an Elixir of
Life, then?" queried the fiend.</p>

<p>"Not yet," returned Hopkins. "But I am
sure I cannot see why, with your assistance, I
should not do so. If you know all the secrets
of the universe, I think you might confide at
least one of them to me, and the only one I
ask is, what shall I do to live for ever?"</p>

<p>"You are an insinuating young man," returned
the fiend. "And I must say I like you,
Toppleton, in spite of your abominable poetry,
for now I am going to be candid with you."</p>

<p>"So much, then, is gained," said Hopkins,
cheerfully. "If you like me, give me the
recipe of life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would, my boy," the fiend replied with
a harsh laugh, "I would do it gladly, if I
hadn't forgotten it. Some day I shall take a
day off from these mundane operations of mine,
and return to the spirit vale and freshen up
my formul&aelig;. Then perhaps I can help you.
But I have something very important to say to
you, and if you will come with me to my own
quarters I will say it. This room is too chilly
for a spirit with nothing on."</p>

<p>Toppleton readily acquiesced. His other
sensations had been so acute since his awakening,
that he did not realize until the fiend
spoke of the chill in the atmosphere that he
was himself cold to the very marrow of his
bones; that his blood seemed hardly to run in
his veins, so congealed had it become. He
followed the fiend, who led the way from
Toppleton's room to Barncastle's own quarters,
where a log fire blazed fiercely on the hearth.
There was no other light than that of the fire
in the room, and Hopkins was glad of it, his
eyes were too weary for any illumination save
the one which made the darkness in which he
now sat even blacker than was natural.</p>

<p>"Lie down there on my bed, Toppleton,"
said the fiend. "Lie down and listen to
me."</p>

<p>Toppleton obeyed, and gladly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a sick man," began the fiend,
"though you may not know it. You have no
more than an even chance of living beyond this
night. If you do live until to-morrow morning
I see no reason why you should not continue to
do so for many years to come; in fact I confidently
anticipate that such will be the case, but
you have got to be careful."</p>

<p>"If you were not one of the supernatural
element, Mr. Greene," said Toppleton, nervously
tapping his fingers together, "I should
be inclined to laugh at your notions respecting
my health. A man of my habits and physique
doesn't go to pieces after a single late supper,
to be brought up standing at the doors of
death uncertain as to whether he will be
invited in or requested to move on, all in a
single night."</p>

<p>"For an acute man you are an obtuse sort of
a person," returned the fiend, gravely. "I do
not mean that you are in immediate danger
of physical collapse, though that will come
shortly unless you take care of yourself. It is a
worse than physical death that I refer to. You
are on the verge of intellectual death, Toppleton.
You need twenty-four hours of wakefulness to
put you in an insane asylum, an incurable,
hopelessly mad for the balance of your days.
You remarked a moment since that you were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
conscious of your head. By that you meant
that you felt the weight of it, and it is a leaden
weight unless my eyes deceive me. I have
experienced it, and I know what it means."</p>

<p>Hopkins' face blanched as the fiend spoke.
It was too easy for him to believe all that had
been said; and why should it not be so, he asked
himself. Here was a case of mortal arrayed in
combat against a supernatural being, and in the
nature of things it was a contest of the intellectuals
and not one of the sort in which Toppleton's
training would have made him an easy
victor. In a bout at arms Barncastle would
have been a prey to Toppleton with scarce an
effort on the American's part, but mind for
mind, the young lawyer was fighting against
terrible odds. He had proven to a very considerable
extent a winner, and yet his victory
was quite as hollow as the victory of a trotting
horse who has won only the preliminary heats
and still has the final test to undergo; but to
win even the trial heat was a great thing, and
that his mind should be well-nigh used up was
to have been expected. Realizing this, and
realizing also that it was his defeated adversary
who was advising him as to what was necessary
to be done for the preservation of his sanity,
he was quite overcome. He nearly fainted, in
fact he would have done so had not the fiend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
seeing his condition applied restoratives to his
head and feet, and poured between his open
lips a concoction which made every drop of
blood in his body glow as with health, which
imparted strength to his weary limbs, and
which seemed to clear his aching head with
its magical potence.</p>

<p>"You have had a narrow escape, my dear
fellow," said the fiend, as Hopkins revived.
"If I hadn't saved you, you would have stepped
over the line."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;are&mdash;very&mdash;very kind," murmured
Hopkins, raising himself on his elbow and then
dropping wearily back into the pillows again.
"You place me under very deep obli&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't speak of that," said the fiend with a
smile. "The obligation you have placed me
under is still greater. But now, Toppleton,
you must sleep, or you will be beyond all hope
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I will," said Toppleton, faintly, and then
he closed his eyes and consciousness departed
from him.</p>

<p>The fiend regarded him for a moment and
turned away with a sigh.</p>

<p>"If I had had the good fortune to operate
on you instead of upon Chatford," he said,
"well, there'd have been a president of the
United States in your family by this time, or,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
better still, a railway king with an amount of
brains equal to the possessions of the best of
them. Oh, well! he wasn't to be had, and I
haven't done badly with Chatford."</p>

<p>With which reflection the fiend passed from
the room, and left Toppleton breathing heavily
in sleep.</p>

<p>When next Toppleton opened his eyes consciously
to himself, he was lying on a great oak
bed with a tapestry canopy over his head. The
sun was streaming in through the broad
mullioned windows. The world without was
white with snow, the tall evergreens down by
the now ice-covered Barbundle presenting the
only vestige of green in sight.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he sighed, as he looked wearily out
of the window. "We shall have a white
Christmas after all, but," he added, gazing
about him, "how the dickens did I ever come
to be here, I wonder? In Barncastle's own
room&mdash;oh, yes, I remember. I fell asleep here
last night and I suppose he has&mdash;Hello!&mdash;Who's
that?"</p>

<p>The last words were addressed to whomsoever
it was that entered the room at the moment,
for the door had opened and closed softly.</p>

<p>"It is I," came a soft, sweet voice, and
before Hopkins had time to place it, Lady
Alice entered the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Toppleton, slightly
embarrassed at the unexpected appearance of
his hostess.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" she replied, coming to
his side and stroking his forehead lightly.
"And I can say with all my heart, after these
awful days of suspense, that it is a good morning.
You have been very ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was nothing," said Hopkins, endeavouring
to conceal his surprise at the way
things were going. "Only a little headache
and rackety feeling generally. It will pass off.
Barncastle was very good to let me have his
quarters."</p>

<p>Lady Alice's face took on a troubled look.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is out," said Toppleton,
turning his eyes toward the snow-clad landscape
again. "I was just thinking that we should
have a white Christmas after all."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, Christmas is over by two
weeks. You have been ill here for three weeks
yesterday."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Toppleton. "I?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said Lady Alice. "Of
course, you didn't know it, but it is so. You
haven't had a lucid moment in all that time."</p>

<p>A sudden fear clutched at Toppleton's
heart.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but tell me, have I&mdash;what do&mdash;what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
have the doctors said&mdash;that I had lost my mind,
was in danger of a living death; that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't get so excited," returned Lady Alice,
softly, still retaining the look of anxiety on her
face. "Here, read this. It is a letter from
your Rocky Mountain friend, I think, and I
fancy it will amuse you. It has only just
come."</p>

<p>"My Rocky Mountain friend!" ejaculated
Hopkins under his breath. "What devilish
complication does this mean, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Shall I open it for you?" asked Lady
Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hopkins mechanically; "I'll be
very much obliged to you if you will do so.
Thank you," he added, staring wildly at the
foot of the bed as the young woman opened
and handed him the letter.</p>

<p>"While you are reading it," said she, "I'll
run downstairs a moment, and tell Parker to
prepare you a little breakfast."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Toppleton, faintly;
and then as Lady Alice went softly from the
room he began to read the letter. "'17, The
Temple, London, January 2nd. My dear Barncastle&mdash;'
Why, she must have made a mistake,"
he said; "this is for Barn&mdash;by Jove! it's in
my handwriting, and signed&mdash;Hopkins&mdash;Top&mdash;ple&mdash;ton.
What in the name of Heav&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he ceased his soliloquizing and began
to read the letter which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Barncastle</span>,&mdash;I understood your
game from the beginning. It was audacious,
but unavailing, as the attack of a finite upon an
infinite mind must always be. I led you on to
your own undoing if you so regard it. I removed
gladly every obstacle from your path, and let you
think in your own conceit that you were an
easy victor in the fight. By so doing I put your
caution asleep, and when your caution slept you
became a victim to my ambition just as did
Chatford, with this exception, that I have left
you in a position to enjoy life, while circumstances
made it necessary for me to place him
in perpetual exile. Perhaps when you get this
letter and realize what I have done, you will
curse me. Do not do so. You are not a loser
in the premises. You have gained the Burningford
estates, you have gained the enjoyment
of the honours which I have won, at the expense
of the difference of strength between the
body I have put off and this one of yours which
I now occupy. The latter, let me say to you,
is a superb specimen, the ideal habitation for
a soul like mine. Aided by it a still greater
future than the one, to be paradoxical, I have
left behind me, will be mine, and not mine only,
but yours also, since it is under your name that
my future greatness is to be achieved. I repeat,
do not curse me, for in cursing me you but
curse yourself, and when you get over the first
sensation of horror at the changes I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
wrought in our respective destinies, and can
think upon it calmly and dispassionately, you
will not find me so much to blame. Nor are you
to be deprived of any of your years by my act.
The infusion of a younger spirit into the corse
of Barncastle will make it young again, and
gradually you will recover the physical ground
you now seem to have lost.</p>

<p>"I sail for New York on the <i>City of Paris</i> to-morrow,
and you may rest assured that the
name that now flies at the mast-head in the
firm of Toppleton, Morley, Bronson, Mawson,
Perkins, Harkins, Smithers and Hicks will no
longer be a mere figurehead, a minimum among
maxima; it will become once more what
it used to be, a tower of strength in the legal
profession, and, permit me to say, a tower of
such height that beside it the famous structure
erected by your illustrious father will become but
as an ant hill to the pyramid of Cheops.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Barncastle, for that is now your
name. In the years to come we may meet
again, and when we do, may it be in friendship,
for as Barncastle I loved myself, and as Toppleton
I love you. May you go and do likewise,
and above all, give up masquerading as a
Broncho poet, and get down to the business for
which you were fitted by nature, if not by birth:
that of a member of the noblest aristocracy in
the world; that of a peer of the British realm.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 7em;">"Faithfully yours,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Hopkins Toppleton</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Barncastle</span>,<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I have had an interview with the
original Chatford, and have informed him that
it is impossible for him to return to his former
corporeal state, because Barncastle no longer
knows the formula by which the re-entrance
can be effected, which is true. He believes it,
and has gone off into space with his whistle
and his sigh."</p></div>

<p>For a moment Toppleton was overcome. This
unexpected denouement was almost too much
for him, but the indignation that surged up in
his breast gave him strength to withstand the
shock; and then, singular to relate, he laughed.</p>

<p>"To think that I should be born a Yankee
and at my time of life become a peer surrounded
by everything that wealth can procure, and
loaded down with every honour that man can
devise; oh, nonsense! it's all a joke, and a
good one. Barncastle saw through my trick,
and is paying me back in my own coin."</p>

<p>Here Hopkins laughed till the room echoed
with his mirth, and as his laugh died away the
door opened and the heiress of Burningford
entered.</p>

<p>"Why, father!" she cried, exultantly, "do
you feel as well&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the word "father," Hopkins' heart gave a
great throb.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said in a moment, "I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
been ill you say for three weeks, and with no
lucid intervals?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And my hallucination was what?"</p>

<p>"That you were that ridiculous American
poet."</p>

<p>"Bring me the glass, my child," said Hopkins,
gravely. "I&mdash;I'd just like to see my face in the
mirror."</p>

<p>The glass was brought and Hopkins looked
into it. The face of Barncastle in very truth
gazed back at him from its silver depths.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "I have changed; have I
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the Lady of Burningford.
"But really I think your illness has done you
good, for I do believe you look ten years
younger."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the new Barncastle, with a
sigh of resignation. "I have worked too hard.
I shall now retire from public life and devote
my remaining years to&mdash;to the accomplishment
of my one great ambition."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked his daughter.</p>

<p>"To becoming a leader in the busy world of
leisure, my child," said Toppleton, falling back
to his pillow once more, and again losing consciousness
in sleep.</p>

<p>This time fortunately the sleep was that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
one who had fought a good fight, had lost,
but whose conscience was clear; and to whom,
after many days, had been restored a sound
mind in a body sound enough to last through
many years of unremitting rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EPILOGUE.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A single</span> year has passed since the episode
which brought our last chapter to a close.</div>

<p>The new Barncastle of Burningford is well
and happy in the paths of pleasantness and
peace, into which he was so unexpectedly and
so unwittingly brought. His daughter has
become engaged to a promising scion of a
neighbouring house of large means and high
estate in the social world. Hopkins Toppleton
is in New York, busy at the practice of the law,
developing a genius in the profession he had
adopted for the convenience of his partners at
which they stand amazed; steadily forging his
way to the front, his energy, his aggressiveness,
and extraordinary fertility of resource dazzling
all beholders.</p>

<p>As for the weary spirit,&mdash;alas for him! He
still whistles, wearily, through space, hopeless
and forlorn, but at all times a welcome visitor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to Burningford, whither he personally went,
shortly after Toppleton's departure for New
York, to lay his petition at the feet of Barncastle
himself. He knows now what has happened
to his young counsel, and his regret for
himself is tempered by his regret for what he has
brought upon him who so nobly undertook to
champion his cause, for the quondam Toppleton
has concealed from his first client the happiness
that he feels over the strange metamorphosis
in his fortunes, lest, comparing it with
his own miserable condition, the exile may
become more unhappy than ever.</p>
